<img src="images/hpir.png" style="width:12%; border:0px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="left">

**Version 0.3.1.** This R package simplifies the construction of house price indexes in R.  Along with three approaches to deriving indexes, it also includes a suite of tools for testing index accuracy, volatility and revision. New to this version is the use of random forests combined with a model agnostic interpretability method to creating HPIs (see working paper [here](https://github.com/andykrause/hpi_research/tree/master/irf)). A dataset of residential home sales from the City of Seattle is also provided with the package.

More information on the package development and usage is available here: [Using hpiR](https://github.com/andykrause/hpiR/blob/master/vignettes/introduction.Rmd)
