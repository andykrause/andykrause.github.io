We had lost our sense of adventure, mostly.  With two small children packing the car and enduring road trip eventualities — soiled car seats, endless questions, whining — creates significant homebody inertia.  Getting out, especially in the short, damp days of a Northwest Winter, was often just too much.  We needed motivation.  

Busy professionals with weak spots for childish competitions and games,  one of us gifted the other a Washington State Parks checklist banner — thanks [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/758790133/wa-state-park-checklists-washington?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=Washington+state+parks&ref=sr_gallery-1-1&organic_search_click=1&cns=1) — for Christmas.  The challenge was on, the game afoot.  Visiting State Parks is a sizable reduction in both investment and payoff, from say, counting continents, countries or even National Parks.  We had checked the map; done right we could probably do 5-7 parks some days.  Our reward would be picnic shelters and boat launches not grand geologic formations and soul-stirring vistas.  Playgrounds not postcards.   

There are a lot of state parks in Washington State, 136 in all, and not all are accessible by car.   The good money would be on us not finishing this quest…and that’s ok, its the journey we seek. In our pre-child mid-twenties, we once visited the Grand Coulee dam. We’ve been to the Mima Mounds, overnighted in Warnambool (twice) and weathered a typhoon in Toba. We are no strangers to long journeys with small payoffs, being surrounded by retirees, RV people and empty parking lots. Though now we are two car seats strong and have a tiny collapsable toiled in the hatch. Adventure takes no universal form.

We were five days into a six-day stay at the in-laws. Sure, Christmas and some unseasonably good weather had eased the psychological toll of having and/or being guests.  Nonetheless, patience wore thin.  Escape called.

The steel gray, bone-chilling damp days had returned.  The eldest child was lured from the house with promises of a beach and eagles and a log cabin and some snacks.  All of these were available, or at least possible, at Spencer Spit — the to-be first stop of our WA Parks Challenge. We had been here many times, in fact, Erin had worked here as a junior park ranger during high school.  It seemed right to take the first step on our home turf.  

The highlight of journey — an eight minute drive — was seeing a white cat perched on a utility box. No tantrums, no detours, no arguments; a solid first step.  

But…the park was closed for the season.  We had stumbled out of the gate.  Or maybe not.  This was our Challenge, we made the rules and the rules became only that we had to get a photo of the entrance sign.  Physical presence within the park boundary is enough to check the box.  It is important to get a thing like this started and important to set expectations.  It certainly won’t be the only time we run into a ‘Park Closed’ sign; now we have precedent.  Case law, if you will.  Plus, we’ll likely be back here many times before we visit all the others.

1 down, 135 to go.
