<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>   </p>
<p><img src="images/waparks.png" style="width:12%; border:0px solid; margin-right: 24px; margin-bottom:15px" align="left"></p>
<p>We had lost our sense of adventure, mostly. With two small children
packing the car and enduring road trip eventualities — soiled car seats,
endless questions, whining — creates significant homebody inertia.
Getting out, especially in the short, damp days of a Northwest Winter,
was often just too much. We needed motivation.</p>
<p>Busy professionals with weak spots for childish competitions and
games, one of us gifted the other a Washington State Parks checklist
banner — thanks <a
href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/758790133/wa-state-park-checklists-washington?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=Washington+state+parks&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-1&amp;organic_search_click=1&amp;cns=1">Etsy</a>
— for Christmas. The challenge was on, the game afoot. Visiting State
Parks is a sizable reduction in both investment and payoff, from say,
counting continents, countries or even National Parks. We had checked
the map; done right we could probably do 5-7 parks some days. Our reward
would be picnic shelters and boat launches not grand geologic formations
and soul-stirring vistas. Playgrounds not postcards.</p>
<p>There are a lot of state parks in Washington State, 137<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> in all, and some not
accessible by car. The good money would be on us not finishing this
quest…and that’s OK, its the journey we seek. In our pre-child
mid-twenties, we once visited the Grand Coulee dam. We’ve been to the
Mima Mounds, overnighted in Warnambool (twice) and weathered a typhoon
in Toba. We are no strangers to long journeys with small payoffs. We’ve
experienced – and enjoyed – being surrounded by retirees, RV people and
empty parking lots. Though now we are two car seats strong and have a
tiny collapsible toilet in the hatch. Adventure takes no universal
form.</p>

<h4>131) <a href="https://www.parks.wa.gov/522/James-Island">Mount
Spokane</a>:</h4>
<p>   </p>
<p>The route from narrow valley of the Spokane River to the peak of the
same name is no straight shot. In and out, up and down, left and right,
stoplights, stop signs and a few roundabouts for good measure. After an
hour of detailed navigation and some white knuckle driving we found
ourselves atop Mt. Spokane.</p>
<p><img src="waparks_files/figure-html/mount_spokane-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_mtspokane.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Here, too, fires from the Rockies had the effect of partially
dampening the impressive vistas. Despite the smoky air, the summit was a
busy place. One crew was working to install some improvements to the
many communications towers that grace the peak while another pair of
guys were meticulously adding the seats back onto the chairlift that
will bring skiers up here in a few short months. We walked past them
both, en route to grab the requisite geocache that was hidden in a small
clump of elevation-stunted and wind-withered trees adorning the top.</p>
<p>We also spent a bit of time admiring the lasting construction of the
summit house and the more ephemeral creations prior guests have made in
the scree field on the north face. We expected the views and the rocks
and breeze; we were not expecting all of the grasshoppers this high up
and were even more surprised at the sign warning of us potential
hantavirus exposure near the Summit House. Satisfied with our long day
of five state parks and nearly as many geocaches, we started back down
the sinuous road; destination: our hotel.</p>

<div id="spokane-river-centennial-trail" class="section level4">
<h4>130) <a href="https://www.parks.wa.gov/487/Centennial-Trail">Spokane
River Centennial Trail</a>:</h4>
<p>   </p>
<p>We exited our Riverside State Park geocaching adventure – one of two
found – directly onto the Centennial Trail. Freshly paved, it was a
quick 3/4 of a mile back to our car. The asphalt radiated heat from the
midday sun meaning we were almost certainly in a triple digit
micro-climate. But its a dry heat, you know.</p>
<p><img src="waparks_files/figure-html/Centennial_Trail-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_centennialtrail.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>My son asked if we could walk all the way to Idaho on the trail, I
said ‘yes, that is the amazing think about the five long distance State
Park Trails in the state…’ and as I went to provide more information he
started to look a bit worried and then asked, ‘but we aren’t going to,
right?’. I think all of my enthusiasm over the the possibility of doing
so had him envisioning a 38-mile death march in the sweltering heat. Not
today, but maybe some day we’d bike the trail.</p>
<p>Back at the car we had a much deserved water break, created a special
collection system for our hard-won geocache treasures and plotted our
sinuous route across town to Mount Spokane. We weren’t five minutes out
of the park and he had fallen fast asleep. The parks quest and
geocaching make for a busy day.</p>

<p>   </p>
<p><img src="waparks_files/figure-html/riverside-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>In contrast to most state parks, Riverside is a sprawling complex
with multiple entry points. To optimize our afternoon drive to Mt.
Spokane and to double-dip by visiting Centennial Trail at the same stop
we chose to explore Riverside at and around Nine Mile Falls. We parked
at the ranger station for a picnic before our hiking adventures. After a
morning in the tree-less Palouse, we welcomed the towering forest that
shaded us from the beating sun. It was approaching the mid-90s with no
breeze to speak of. I’d like to say we had a peaceful lunch, but my son
– being half of his mother’s blood – was overly concerned with a yellow
jacket the entire meal; the swatting at of which dumped more food around
thereby increasing the swarm of insects in our general vicinity. It was
an episode of Bluey meets the Three Stooges.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_riverside.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Escaping lunch with out harm, we made a quick move to the Carlson
trailhead for a short hike. For me, I needed to stretch my legs after a
long morning drive. The child was hot-blooded about geocaches and we
found a trail that alleged to have two of them along it. Our first –
which was supposed to be an easy find – was an utter failure. We
searched high and low only to eventually realize that the app has a
‘recent finds’ log where all of the most recent cachers had also noted
its disappearance. Apparently, some muggler – an individual not versed
in the art of ’caching – had likely stolen it on account of the ease of
its location.</p>
<p>Disheartened and hot, we forged on to the next cache. Hereto we met
with initial failure, but did eventually find the small box stashed
beneath a large piece of bark. I logged it while the child traded one of
his trinkets for one of those in the cache. It’s the thrill of the
unknown treasure that drives him…and if that gets us out hiking and
orienting and, in general, enjoying the outdoors that is fine by me.</p>

<div id="steptoe-battlefield" class="section level4">
<h4>128) <a

Battlefield</a>:</h4>
<p>   </p>
<p><img src="waparks_files/figure-html/steptoe_battlefield-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We’ve been asked a number of times during our parks quest about the
best state park. To be honest, it is hard to pick a absolute favorite.
Similarly, it would have been hard to choose a worst park had someone
asked…until today. Steptoe Battlefield is the clear front runner for
worst of the 137 parks. Maybe ‘worst’ is too harsh. ‘Least exciting’,
‘uninteresting-est’, ‘most like a roadside shrine’.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_steptoebattlefield.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>The small obelisk surrounded by a low, metal fence which is further
surrounded by a gravel driveway can be found on the southeastern corner
of the small burg of Rosalia. Rosalia is famous, not for the
battlefield, but for the beautiful arched railroad bridge just south of
town. Perhaps the sole redeeming quality of Steptoe Battlefield is that
if you wander out away from the memorial to the east you can catch a
glimpse of this picturesque viaduct.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise that we were the only visitors. Hoping
to, at the very least, learn something about the battle we parked and
made haste to the interpretive signage. Signage which had been removed
and was awaiting updating. We imagined the details of the famous battle
here and headed into the open meadow to the east to search for any
shields, swords or arrows that may have been discarded during the fight.
Our search was unsuccessful, but we did locate an old iron railroad
spike; a find which brought much glee and speculation to the five-year
old traveler. Now in the spirit of finding things, a stroke of luck
caused me to check the Geocaching app for anything nearby as getting
back in the car after such a short break would dampen spirits for sure.
By some miracle there was a well-hidden cache in one of the trees in the
park. The remainder of our trip would now be defined by our Geocaching
escapades. Lemon -&gt; Lemonade.</p>

Butte</a>:</h4>
<p>   </p>
<p><img src="waparks_files/figure-html/steptoe_butte-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Day two of our father/son roadtrip. Last night our plans to camp
along the Columbia River were derailed by high temperatures and higher
wind. Fearing an uncomfortable night sweating in the tent whilst being
blown about by 40mph gusts, we pushed on past Vantage and settled for
one of the few remaining hotel rooms in Moses Lake. Up early, we bolted
east along I-90 until Sprague where we exited onto the gentle, sinuous
State Highway 23. We wound through the Palouse – recently harvested so
lacking the stock-photo quality scenery common during some parts of the
year – for about an hour with little company save a few antelope and a
lone school bus.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_steptoebutte.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Steptoe Butte is a sore thumb in the otherwise rolling hills of
east-central Washington. As such it is visible for miles away. Possibly
once scenic, the communications towers now adorning its peak have
reduced it to more of a curious landmark and less of a natural wonder.
After curving around to the east of it, we headed straight for the peak
up the winding road that is wide enough for two cars in most places but
definitely in need of some work. Guardrails are occasional; vehicular
traffic was non-existent, though we did encounter a single runner
heading down from the peak.</p>
<p>The top is composed of a crumbling parking lot, multiple cell towers
and their support buildings and a few interpretive signs. Just enough
smoke hung in the air from wildfires far to the east to hinder the truly
impressive vistas. Alone atop the world (or the third highest point in
Whitman County) on a windy Thursday morning in early September, my
companion had us tramp around in search of fossils and gems; tragically
none of which were found.</p>

<p>   </p>
<p><img src="waparks_files/figure-html/james_island-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>After a big breakfast we boarded the boat – a 37-foot Axopar – headed
home to Seattle. Six 40-year-old(ish) guys on a quick weekend away in
Friday Harbor to celebrate the passing of another of us into middle age.
As first mate, I had forgotten to untie one of the lines as we attempted
to pull away from our spot at G30 in the Friday Harbor marina, an err
easily, but embarassedly remedied. We then quickly realized we had
forgotten a few things in the hotel rooms, forever lost to a backroom
lost-and-found no doubt. Foreshadowing, perhaps, for the afternoon’s
events.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_jamesisland.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>As it wasn’t too far out of the way we swung into James Island for a
quick hike. The captain is well aware of our State Parks quest has been
very helpful in getting us to a number of the Marine State Parks, saving
us very long and potentially treacherous paddleboarding adventures. The
weather was fantastic, 60 and sunny with a very light wind. Much to our
surprise there was just enough room at the public pier for a boat of our
length and we easily docked, our starboard side in. No need for the
dinghy this morning.</p>
<p>The 1.5 mile loop hike around the SW section of the island is
enjoyable and offers some stellar views of Decatur Island and southward
to Lopez and down to the Olympics. It is rated as a black diamond
(difficult) which seems a bit of a stretch. That said, there are a few
high cliff faces to pass over meaning it is not the best option for
small children, those with poor balance or anyone of moderate
inebriation and gusto (always a dangerous combination). It was morning,
we were sober and thoroughly enjoyed stretching our legs before the
60-mile run home to Seattle. Shortly after departing James, our left
engine began to struggle to keep pace. We slowed. It struggled some more
and we slowed some more. Soon the right one had caught the same issue.
What was meant to be a two-hour tour turned into a five-hour one. We
eventually made it – Gilligan we were not – but nonetheless were
reminded of the uncertainties of travel, especially that by sea.</p>

<p>It could be said that Conconcully and its eponymous State Park are
not on the way to anywhere. While the road doesn’t actually end there –
a few campgrounds and a winding road to Tiffany Mountain can be reached
by going through town – civilization more or less ceases to exist after
this point. This is the last stop for gas and beer.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_conconully.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>On this dreary Thursday morning in May not much was stirring at the
park. A few RVs were settled into the campground along with a lone tent.
The picnic tables, the day shelters, the large, well-adorned playground
and the open field surrounded by massive, tired looking willow trees
were all empty; mired in their winter slumber. A low dark cloud hung
tight on the surrounding mountain tops while sunlight peaked in from the
clear skies to the east. The lighting together with the complete absence
of other people (but the evidence of their past presence) was acutely
post-apocalyptic.</p>
<p>To test that feeling and the push my luck, I took at hike down into
the lake bed so garishly exposed due to the low level of the waterbody.
Past rusted out wheel wells and a variety of sunken objects, I
eventually made my way to the water’s current edge. To the west many
previously waterfront homes now had long, dry docks and small watercraft
beached upon the shore. The mass and height of vegetation in the lake
bed suggested it had been years since those boats had cut the water. On
my way back to the car I came upon a park ranger who had been cautiously
watching my odd hiking route. With the requisite nod I let him know I
was good people. I then backtracked to Okanogan and eventually Mazama
for a weekend in the Methow…so, I guess, in some fashion Conconully was
on the way to somewhere after all.</p>

<p>We were headed west out of Bellingham Bay on a 24-ft craft in what
could have been described as ‘soupy seas.’ It wasn’t an uncomfortable
ride, but not one in which you could leave your drink unattended on the
table either. Even with the sustained sunbreaks we were thankful for the
heated cabin. Eventually, in the lee of Lummi Island we found a calmer
patch, but summer boating this was not.</p>

<p>Our stated course would have taken us directly to Olga and the Buck
Bay Shellfish Farm – a birthday dinner for a friend. The captain, having
learned our of on-going endeavor to visit all 137 state parks, offered a
slight detour so that we could check off one of the fourteen standing
between us and our historic feat. With the kids safely in the company of
professional care back on the mainland, time was of no consequence and
we graciously accepted the offer. Minutes later we were tying up to the
small, public dock tucked on the north, and calm, side of the postage
stamp island. We disembarked, drinks in hand, for a short hike to its
sunny southern side. Along the moss-strewn trail we noted a few
camping-worthy locations and enough beach to keep kids busy – all
scouting for future, overnighty stays.</p>
<p>Back on the boat and on course again, headed for Buck Bay. The public
dock there was not yet in for the season, leading to an adventurous
series of boardings bookending our delicious meal. No one took an
unexpected bath, though the opportunities were numerous. Looking back,
this qualifies as the first entirely unplanned state park’s visit we’ve
had to date, and mostly likely the last.</p>

<p>Prior to our State Parks quest we had been to Wallace Falls many
times; there was little here we had not seen before. Seasoned
adventurers of the Skykomish River valley we knew to always arrive early
to avoid the savage melee that is parking here at 10 am on a decent
weekend morning. It is University Village but without the gelato and
shiny new MacBooks. Such scenes are an ill-match for my temperament. As
such, we were parked and on the trail by 8:30.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_wallacefalls.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Though the snow melt and recent rains would have undoubtedly whipped
the series of falls into a mist-spraying torrent, we opted for the
longer, flatter and less scenic trip up the Greg Ball trail to Wallace
Lake. This decision was partly due to our appetite for the extra mileage
and partly due to our disdain for dodging dog leashes and wayward hikers
on the main falls trail. Being honest, mostly the latter.</p>
<p>We misanthropes were rewarded with a peaceful 4-mile hike up to the
lake at which we took the requisite photo and bathroom break and
promptly returned the same way. There were some magical stretches where
the sun shone through the mist into broad swathes of trees coated in
thick moss giving it a very Olympic-rain-forest-esque feeling. That
said, a first-time visitor should definitely stay on the Woody Trail and
see the falls; for those in search of solitude and uninterrupted
trekking the lake remains the better option. On our way home, a long
line of Subarus were queued, waiting for a parking spot; we sold the
rights to ours for $12 in cash, two warm White Claws and a pint of
blood.</p>

<p>We packed the boat with beverages and snacks and were out of the
Jarrell Cove State Park marina by 10am. Seven strong, we pushed south,
our destination Hope Island State Park (the Mason County version). Upon
arrival we found the single mooring buoy occupied by a lone 14-ft
aluminium boat. Absent any means of locomotion and manned only by a
single seagull, this was either a prop from a movie about a fisherman
lost at sea or, more likely, some local boater ‘reserving’ this buoy for
future use. We likely had numbers, but any fracas caused by our
appropriation of the space would only further the stereotype of north
sounders in big boats. Taking the virtuous path, we anchored nearby
drastic reducing the distance to our landing point.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_hopeislandmason.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>After two dinghy trips our motley crew was ashore, some in the
well-placed Adirondack chairs greeting visitors on the southeastern
corner of the island. Heading counter-clockwise, we took a side trip
down through the old Schmidt family (Olympia Brewery) homestead – now a
park attendant residence – down to the large park sign on the far
southern tip of the island. From there we hiked up through the center of
the island, a landscape curiously wet, more akin to those small hollows
on the western slopes of the Cascades than the Madrone covered shores of
most Puget Sound islands.</p>
<p>We finished the loop, about a mile and half in length, and then
worked again to ferry all party members back to the boat. Four trips
with the small inflatable filled to capacity and not a single man
overboard. It probably helped that very few libations had been consumed
before this noon hour. Speaking of a thirst, the walk had arisen one in
most of us and from here we made the short trip south to Olympia to see
what our State’s fine capital had to offer in the way of lunch and
brew.</p>

<p>According to the calendar it was autumn. After dumping much needed
rain last weekend, Mother Nature had decided to give Seattle another
taste of summer; perhaps its final of the season. Perfect blue skies,
little in the way of wind and temperatures expected near 70. Great
timing for a scheduled day off of work.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_eagleisland.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>We were at the marina just shy of 9am, prepared for a three-day,
two-night trip on a friend’s new boat. A celebration of another of us
passing into middle age (40), it was to be an affair absent children and
wives/partners. Just a few guys, a boat, some board games and place to
stay in the South Sound. We filled the morning with a hike on Blake
Island (#28) and lunch at Point Defiance.</p>
<p>Our ride from Tacoma south proved eventful, multiple orca sightings,
a pass under the Narrows bridge and close up view of Washington’s own
Alcatraz – McNeil Island. Tucked between McNeil and Anderson Islands is
the postage stamp-sized Eagle Island Marine State Park. We found a
mooring buoy on the west side and paddled the dinghy into the oncoming
tide and up onto shore. In short order, we circumambulated the island,
finding little in the way of evidence of human habitation other than a
single, sketchy looking rope swing – of which an attempt to operate
nearly resulted in an acute hernia. With a building thirst and some
tricky logistics ahead at our Harstine Island vacation home, we didn’t
linger. Back to the boat and onward to our evening moorage at Jarrell

<p>After setting aside our Parks quest for the summer – mostly on
account of a packed schedule and having knocked off most of the ‘easy’
parks to date – we returned to take on the remaining eighteen. Mount
Pilchuck is the only park accessible solely by foot and only for part of
the year. Given fall is approaching, we needed to get this one done in
the next few weeks or wait til June. And, while our kids like wandering
around in the woods, the 6.3-mile round-trip hike is more than they are
ready for at this stage. We had grandparents at the house, alas, we
sanctioned this an adult-only venture.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_mountpilchuck.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>We left the city at 6:30, and arrived at the trailhead just after
9am. The road from the highway has seen better days and the seven miles
takes about 40 minutes to complete. While our Subaru was sufficient, a
Jeep would have been welcome. The clouds were thick and low, but the
morning drive teased us with blue sky far to the east and we hoped that
the summit would peak through and offer views above. A dozen or so other
cars had beaten us to the start. Pre-kids, we would have considered this
a hit to our reputation of being the earliest hikers on the trail, but
now we are just thankful to get in a child-free trek.</p>
<p>For the first few miles we were mired in the clouds. A cool morning,
but little wind so it was an ideal temperature for hiking. The trail
isn’t difficult in the sense of length or grade, but its very rocky and
uneven so its a slower slog than a typical PNW hike of this character.
As we entered into the rocky, open valley to the north of the peak, we
broke through the clouds and were greeted with views of all the other
sky islands amidst the white puffy sea. From our vantage point here that
was most Three Fingers in the foreground with Mt Baker and Glacier Peak
looming large in the background. The views only improved at the fire
lookout on the top. Here we had a 360 degree panorama of all the nearby
peaks above about 4,500 feet, again with Mt. Rainier and others large in
the distance. There was a fair bit of activity at the top and having
been up here many times before we didn’t linger long. Soon were on our
way back down into the clouds, to the car and then the long battle
through potholes to the main road.</p>

<p>The farther south we traveled, the better the traffic, the lighter
our nerves. Ocean City was busy but not overly crowded. We parked and
loaded up our backpacks with the requisite beach gear; snacks and sand
toys for them, caffeine for us.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_oceancity.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>The wind had picked up some speed though countered by intermittent
sun breaks. In sum, it was no real warmer than earlier this morning; a
standard chill for this part of the world regardless of the hour or
season. We tucked into a moderately protected divot between dunes for a
late second breakfast or early lunch. It became a quick one as well as
an army of red ants chased us from our little pocket back out into the
gust and gale. Fresh fruit was a bad idea.</p>
<p>We migrated over to the riverine area where the other families were
letting their spawn run wild in the inch deep meander of fresh water
slowly making its way to the open ocean. Our kids fell right in with
their predecessors; smashing sand castles, borrowing pails without
asking and avoiding any notion of proper social distancing. Out here –
in the wind and wild – it was easy to forget the past 14 months of masks
and quarantining. Children seemed to transition back to normal the
easiest. The next hour or so was filled with standard the beach
engineering tasks of bridge and dam building, digging, mud-flinging,
boot emptying. Eventually back to the car as we hoped to time the
three-hour drive home with their well-deserved naps – though to be fair,
we were just as deserving, if not more, of a mid-day slumber and one we
would wouldn’t get.</p>

<p>Leaving Pacific Beach we thought we had left the insanity of the
razor clam crowd behind us. Oh sweet ignorance! Heading south on Highway
109 traffic was constant but not limiting. That all changed when we
reach the Roosevelt Beach entrance – the main gateway to this portion of
the shore on which the digging madness was centered.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_griffithspriday.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>The northbound traffic was stalled as vehicles waited (for them a
left turn across traffic) both for us south bounders to pass as well as
for the clammers-to-be to file out onto the beach and to their
destination of choice. And, possibly, for some form of DNR or game
warden checking licenses and equipment at the beach entrance. A
speculative asseration on my part, but the only logical one I could come
up with for why it would take so long to drive out onto an open beach.
At first, the backup looked bad. As we drove on against the line of cars
it continued. And continued. And continued. Five miles later it was
still going. No, ‘going’ is the wrong word. Stopped. The traffic was
still stopped five miles down the road, bumper to bumper to access the
beach. Hundreds upon hundreds of cars, many with none-to-pleasant looks
on their faces. These weren’t stoned hippies waiting to get into
Woodstock. It was stressed out parents with screaming kids in the back
and full bladders from their morning coffees. It was the wildest, most
ill-managed and somewhat dangerous (as many cars gave up and performed
U-turns and plainly inappropriate locations along the highway) roadway
situation I’d been a part of – if only as an observer – in some time.
For those who waited it out, what a true dedication to their hobby. Few
things, save dire medical attention, would entice me to enter into
and/or remain in a melee of that magnitude.</p>
<p>Once we had cleared the end of the line, the atmosphere returned to
normal, or at least that of a busy holiday weekend on the coast. Wary of
getting stuck in another such line-up, our stay at Griffiths-Priday was
quite short, preferring to get closer to our eventual outlet road
farther south before spending an measurable time not moving closer to
home.</p>

<p>It was the last open window of razor clam season. During a very low
tide. On a holiday weekend. In a season where only one zone of the coast
was open for harvesting. We are not clammers. We knew none of these
facts prior to our arrival at Pacific Beach State Park on this blustery
Saturday morning. Nor, to be honest, even if we had known all of those
things would we have been prepared for the situation we had,
unwittingly, wandered into.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_pacificbeach.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>To say that a mass of humanity had descended on the coast here would
be no exaggeration, no poetic license taken with the truth. As far as
the eye could see both north and south the receding tide was packed,
nearly shoulder-to-shoulder, with clam gun-wielding Northwesterners.
Their vehicles haphazardly parked on the hardpack just below last
night’s high tide line; their dogs and kids running feral in the
intertidal zone. All this madness for 15 clams. That and a morning spent
out of doors along the wild Washington coast. I’m told they are
delicious (when not toxic), but I’d venture many are out here as much
for ritual as for the reward…and the merits of that particular
motivation I shall not question.</p>
<p>We were the odd ones out here, once again. We had parked on land and
walked out into the sand dunes far from the water to enjoy the beach
itself, not the mollusks hidden beneath. With the proximate crowd, there
was no shortage of entertainment – cars racing up and down the coast, a
low-flying parasailer, a not-so-abandoned driftwood fort, kites of all
sizes and colors. And wind. It was cold. We held out as long as we could
and then back to the car, perhaps the only group leaving the beach with
dry feet and no dinner catch.</p>

appears to have subsided. Nor had the astronomical price of lumber
created a second ‘wood rush’. No, Forks was just as sleepy and calm as

<p>Like the fortunes of the town, we had an up and down stay. It started
poorly when our trip to La Push and Third Beach was derailed on account
the reservation’s closure. We rebounded with a positively adventurous
and fulfilling detour to Rialto Beach and it’s massive driftwood,
crashing waves and sentinel sea stacks. Crashing back down to earth, a
wallet was lost during the procurement of dinner, resulting in many
phone calls and doubling back of our steps. We each walked the streets
of Forks between the restaurant and our hotel multiple times looking
under planters, behind benches and in garbage cans. No doubt providing
some comic relief to the handful of store owners and locals milling
about the dormant downtown. After eliminating the potential of it being
in our car or our room, we concluded that someone had likely found it
and, with the contact information in it, was quite unmotivated to find
its rightful owner.</p>
<p>Tragedy behind us, we had a nice stay at the Pacific Inn and left
early in the morning for points southward. Our first stop was Bogachiel
State Park. We had a lot of driving to go, so we didn’t linger. Long
enough to bask in the the aura of the place – and take a peek around for
our missing wallet; we were still in the search and find phase – and
then off to coast via 101 South.</p>

<p>We, generally, as a rule, do not travel on holiday weekends. COVID
appears to have dislodged that tenet from our collective minds. The
judiciousness of following it came rushing back to us upon arrival at
the Edmonds ferry terminal early on the Saturday of Memorial Day
weekend. The Olympic Peninsula a popular destination for many; many
others who avoided the Friday rush only to meet with a similar fate the
next morning. Fewer RVs than one might expect, so perhaps we found
ourselves in with the daytripper crowd. Eventually we boarded the boat
for Kingston; our wait rewarded with the sight of a pod of Orcas en
route.</p>

into Sequim Bay State Park. Orienting ourselves, we took the steep route
straight down to the beach side picnic area. The tide was out. Way out.
-2.4 feet to be exact, about as low as it gets this time of year. This
provided for a muddy, yet entertaining walk out in the bay.</p>
<p>Many crabs were deprived of their temporary shelters, but none
permanently harmed. Empty oyster shells collected and discarded and
collected again. It was difficult to tell who had more fun, the kids
stepping near the razor clams with the hope of eliciting a jet of upward
water, or the clams themselves who claimed unsuspecting victims a few
times, soaking shorts and shirts alike. We returned the car via the
drier land route – including a pass over the small wooden bridge and

<p>It was a perfectly clear day and from I-5 Mount St. Helens stood out
sharply against the sky. The gaping hole where the peak once was a stark
reminder of the fury that covered this valley just 41 years ago. We
rarely see the mountain this early in the year when snow covers it so
completely. Actually, we Seattlites rarely see it at all unless we make
our way south of Tacoma – a trip fraught with traffic and usually
generating a fair dose of condescension.</p>

<p>En route to Seaquest our 4-year old became very excited about the
prospect of a mountain that could explode and lose its top, though I
don’t think he fully bought into the idea that the entire top wasn’t
just laying somewhere, despite our best assurances. Unfortunately, the
St. Helens visitor center that shares the grounds with Seaquest State
Park was closed for COVID so we could not rely on the official
interpretive displays to corroborate our story.</p>
<p>Instead of videos of explosions and relief maps showing the location
of the lahars, we settled for a picnic lunch in the sun and walk around
the one-mile loop out into the Silver Lake bog. The views of the
mountain from here were superb, as was the bird spotting…though truth be
told none of us are really orinithologically-inclined and I think grainy
live footage of lava would have held more intrigue for our entire
crew.</p>

back to the Washington side of the river for our eventual drive back to

was Spring Creek Hatchery. The State Park portion of the complex is a
bit of an add-on to the larger, nationally-run, fish hatchery itself. A
small park for sure.</p>

<p>As is common, the wind was brisk and biting at 8am on an April
morning. Our hot coffees and warm coats weren’t quite enough to feel
comfortable down by the water. The park is favorite location for
windsurfing and kiteboarding – two activities that play particularly
poorly with the responsibilities of raising small children, so a bit of
non-amenity for our group. This early Monday morning no other wind sport

railroad and the highway. Signage could adequately be described as
discrete. Once parked you make a pedestrian crossing of the very active
railline and then descend to a small nob of lond that juts out into the
river. Our expectations were low on arrival.</p>
<p>As we settled into a small hollow that was shielded from the wind,
the clouds broke and the sun shone down on us. And, just like that, it
was warm and comfortable. The kids frolicked on the ground while the
adults rolled up our sleeaves and pants and enjoyed the beating rays
upon our wintered skin. There is nothing quite like soaking up the sun
in a warm, natural place early in spring. When the sun is an onomaly, a
welcome outlier and when us PNWers are so deprived of vitamin D. We
stayed much longer than we first thought on account of the pleasant
conditions. Doug’s Beach, despite its modest entryway, is worth a
stop.</p>

<p>Yesterday’s weather was unseasonably warm. Then it snowed, ever so
slightly, over night and it was cold, cloudy and windy when we awoke.
Not to be deterred, we headed east out of Hood River bound for Maryhill
State Park. On this Hood River trip we were joined by the
Malcolm-Michener family who proved amenable to State Park hopping for
the day. On our journey east we passed a number of signs for Oregon
State Parks, leading me to joke (partially) that perhaps when we
finished Washington’s parks we could start to do Oregon’s (256 in
total). But let’s not get ahead of ourselves here.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_maryhill.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>We had hoped that by going 40 miles east the weather might improve,
or at the very least that the sun would show. No such luck. It was just
as cold and cloudy at Maryhill, and, quite possibly even windier. A
well-placed, three-sided shelter served as an ideal base as we spent
brief periods out in the blusters only to return to warm up and for the
children to re-fuel on the smorgasboard of snacks that were laid
out.</p>
<p>The Maryhill State Park is one comnponent of a larger ‘complex’ of
attractions here together with a museum, a winery and a veteran’s
memorial. Not just any veteran’s memorial either, but one built as an
exact replica of Stonehenge as it was believed to have been when fully
complete. Just off of the highway, it attracts a fair number of visitors
and here, unlike the park itself, we had a lot of company. All of us
shivering while attempting to use the large slabs of rock to buffet
against the persistant gale. While the parking area and the grounds
could use a bit of more upkeep, it is a worthwhile stop, not only for
the chance to reflect on those who gave all for our country and the
novelty of the structure itself, but also for the views of the beginning
(east-most) section of the Gorge that the elevated site provides.</p>

<p>En route to Hood River, Paradise Point served as a perfect midway
point to get out and stretch our legs. The kids slept nearly the entire
way from Seattle and, having last eaten over two hours ago were ready
for a snack.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_paradisepoint.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Getting to the park is an odd, little backtrack from the exit along
the I-5 itself. Eventually after a mile or so on a road with a 5mph
speed limit – which feels like absolutely crawling after going 80 on the
freeway for two hours – you arrive at a small parking lot and attached
beach right at the base of the freeway bridge. During our State Park
Challenge we’ve been to beaches on the ocean, lakes and rivers. Small
beaches and large ones. Rocky, sandy and mucky. This was the first beach
(and probably only) this is located primarily underneath a major
interstate highway. If you can ignore the sound of heavy truck overhead
and the murky river water the sand does look nice.</p>
<p>We did not swim, on account of time, of course. We did gorge
ourselves on dried fruits, nuts and fig bars while working to pick each
and every dandelion on the park’s lawn (the little one’s favorite past
time). Back in the car and on our way to the Columbia Gorge.</p>

<p>The most interesting part of Bottle Beach State Park is what it never
became. At one point in the 1890s, this small area of beach was prepping
to become the next great Pacific ocean port of Ocosta-by-the-Sea. Land
was plotted, a dock was built but eventually the harbor was judged to be
insufficient and the railroad never came. No railroad meant no boomtown
and Ocosta-by-the-Sea slowly died away. As it turns out, Ocosta was a
bit of a pawn in a dispute between Aberdeen and the Northern Pacific
Railway, its fortunes somewhat artificially hyped at great expense to
speculators who lost their savings.<br />
<img src="images/waparks_bottlebeach.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>If you zoom in to Bottle Beach with the standard Google Maps tiles
you can still see the plotted roads as shown on the park boundaries.
Switching to satellite mode removes most of these indicators, but if you
squint hard enough you can pick up a few places where the old city was
located – or at least planned to be. As an urban planner by training,
this form of ‘archaeology’ is incredibly appealing to me, though I do
not suspect the average visitor finds as much pleasure in it.<br />
The driving rain continued and our stay here was short. Our sixth and
last park of the morning. We switched drivers and got comfortable for
the three hour trip home. I’m sure the kids will be happy to see us and
the grandparents relieved to be able to return to their lives as
childless retirees.</p>

<p>Erin is a lighthouse aficionado. Thus, with great excitement we
approached Westport Light State Park, home to the tallest light house in
the state: Gray’s Harbor Lighthouse, 107 feet tall, was originally
constructed in 1897.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_westportlight.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, we were a bit disappointed. To begin with it was
closed, so no internal visit, no climb to the top. Next, it is located
nearly three-forths of mile from the ocean, a siting that gives it the
weird feeling of being a toy replica built for tourists, not a working
lighthouse going about it day saving ships. This wasn’t always the case
– the construction of the jetty created tremendous beach growth over the
past century leading to the lighthouse’s current positioning –
nonetheless, the lack of a seaside views and sounds definitely takes
away from the wonderment of a lighthouse.</p>
<p>We also drove around to the north end of the park (officially the
Westhaven annex) and braved a short hike out to the beach mostly just to
take a short video to show the kids the raw power of nature with it
blowing wind and sand. Within a few minutes we were both soaked but also
both very awake and alive, jolted by the adrenaline rush from having to
fight to stay upright.</p>

is advertised as the ‘classic Washington State Park experience’.
Camping, Yurts, picnics areas, dunes and a near perfect beach.</p>
<p>Any sign of a harbor, let alone two, was absence however. In protest
of the misleading nomenclature – and also due to the rapidly
deteriorating weather – we kept our visit short. One could have easily
imagined spending an entire day out on the beach letting our children
run wild like the feral animals they can be. For two rain-soaked adults
the expiration time is much less than that.</p>

<p><img src="waparks_files/figure-html/graylandbeach-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>At Grayland Beach we indulged in a quintessential Washington Coast
activity – driving right out onto the beach. The hard pack sand here is
so solid that it easily supports vehicle traffic. The first time I did
this back when I was a newbie to the Northwest it scared me a
bit…perhaps an odd response from someone who grew up driving vehicles
out onto frozen lakes for four months of the year.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_graylandbeach.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Normally, one would get out and explore the beach. Not today. By this
point the wind was blowing in from the southwest at a steady 30 miles
per hour, sending small rivers of moving sand along the beach. The rain
was coming down hard, driven sideways. Everything was a shade of gray or
brown, no color anywhere. With our car positioned directly into the wind
it was difficult to open the doors and exit the vehicle. Out here there
is no protection, no shelter from Mother Nature’s wrath. At times like
these it is amazing that any trees stand along the coast.</p>
<p>Safely back on Highway 105 and away from the open ocean, the weather
was much more manageable. Just another blustery and rainy spring day in
Southwest Washington.</p>

<p>At the northern end of the Long Beach peninsula – again the world’s
longest continuous beach – lies the Willapa Wildlife Refuge and
Leadbetter State Park. It is where the sand bar finally curls up and
gives way to the ocean and the outflow of the Willapa River. The main
trails and parking for the park are on the calm, non-coastal side of
this narrow strip of land, which this morning meant for a much more
pleasant outdoor experience, being shielded from the wind.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_leadbetterpoint.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>The tide was down and the mud flats stretched out over what seemed
like an eternity. The sky and the water were the same shade of gray. We
saw no sign of other humans or their enterprises; a calm anticipation of
the rain to come hung in the air.</p>
<p>We entertained ourselves with a short 30-minute hike. First up the
beach on the hard-pack sand, then veering into the forest and returning
through the once-sand dunes now home to a unique coastal mix of trees
and shrubs. Returning to the car, we plotted out the remains of our day.
Our next stop – Grayland Beach – was only 13 miles due north, but would
take us nearly 90 to drive to it, effectively circumambulating Willapa
Bay…there are few straight roads out here, save those up and down the
Long Beach peninsula.</p>

<p>We had no small amount of trouble finding lodging last night at 7pm.
COVID had, apparently, not dampened many travelers’ Spring Break plans.
Eventually we landed a room at the Breakers. Nominally a hotel, in
reality it is more of an old and poorly maintained set of condominium
towers. And full to the brim. Upon arrival in our room, we could have
mistaken it for the tuberculosis wing of a hospital given the coughing
fits in the neighboring unit. No doubt, the previous occupant had
vacated their reservation early on account of the din. Their loss
became, well, our loss too (though I guess it beat sleeping in the
car).</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_pacificpines.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Nonetheless, we managed a moderately adequate night of sleep and were
up early to hit the road. Rain was in the forecast; the abnormally
gorgeous early spring weather had broken in favor of a day more
climatically fitting situation. We headed north up the Long Beach
peninsula, past dozens of RVs parks and small motels and inns, all doing
good business. Every few miles a sign reminds you that you are on the
world’s longest continuous beach.</p>
<p>Our first stop was Pacific Pines State Park, a small 10-acre park
designed for day use only. On account of COVID or maybe the season, the
park was closed. Primarily a picnic spot along the beach, I’m not sure
we missed a lot given the hour (6:30 am) and the cold front-driven wind
bearing down from the west.</p>

<p><img src="waparks_files/figure-html/capedisappointment-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>From the Yakima Valley down through the Columbia Gorge and out to the
coast, we had covered a lot of ground today. And many parks too; this
being our 9th of the day. Of those we visited, we had, fortunately,
saved the best for last. This far out, the weather had cooled and the
wind arisen, but it was still a very much above average day for March in
the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_capedisappointment.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Cape Disappointment is where the mighty Columbia finally meets her
match in the broad Pacific Ocean. While high tides can back her up all
the way to Longview, at lower ones she casts a vicious snare – known as
the Columbia Bar – far out into the sea. It was here, on this north side
of the river, that the Corps of Discovery first glanced upon the
Pacific; their journey now halfway complete. A grand spot from which to
stop and admire the edge of the continent, only to turn back around and
hoof it home.</p>
<p>The bluffs and heads are much the same as they were hundreds and
possibly thousands of years ago. The ocean front beach here, however, is
quite new having filled in with sand recently due to the construction of
the northern jetty at the mouth of the river. We pieced together a few
different trails and roads to take us on a scenic 5-mile loop of the
park. Up and down some inclines, to the closed interpretative center,
then back out the newly formed beach and finally, ending on the same
hill that the early Europeans discovers used to view the ocean from. A
hill which also served for a brief period of time as a military
installation, now abandoned. Our daylight and stamina ran out well
before the wonders and history of the park did. Cape Disappointment is
very high on the list of parks we want to return to again in the
future.</p>

<p>From Battleground Lake we crossed over the Columbia in Oregon at
Longview. It was our first time being out of the State of Washington in
more than 18 months. Certainly the longest time I’ve spent in a single
state during my adult life. Our stay in Oregon wasn’t long, though, as
we crossed back over into Washington again on the Astoria-Megler bridge;
a true feat of engineering.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_fortcolumbia.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Approaching from the east you drive under Fort Columbia State Park
before you enter it. One must then double back up the hill to the former
battlement and barracks perched high on the cliff side overlooking the
mouth of the Columbia. Very little imagination is need to understand why
this was a strategic location during our initial tussles with the
British over this part of the world and then our later concerns over
Japanese troops expanding the Pacific Theater to our shores.</p>
<p>The remaining battlements and barracks are few in number and
relatively closely packed – at least in comparison to much larger
installations at Fort Worden, Fort Flagler and Fort Ebey. Nonetheless,
the grounds are well kept and the views are fantastic. A number of the
old barracks are rentable as vacation homes. A reminder to us that we
had not yet found lodging for the night – a task we thought would be
simple given it was March. Time would prove us wrong.</p>

crawled, every so slowly toward the park from our previous stop at Reed
Island. Past endless CVSs, Walgreens, gas stations and garages, a Fred
Meyer and Target or two. In this far NE corner of the Portland Metro
everyone was out for a drive on this Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>The sun was out and it was a warm day for March. And while not all of
the weekend drivers were at the park, but most appeared to be. We still
had the coast on our mind for the evening so we didn’t bother fighting

including a three-month COVID-induced hiatus. Not the original one year
we aimed for to see them all but still a decent pace. Thirty-seven to
go, which may not seem like a lot but it does include many of the most
remote and difficult to access. We’ve our work cut out for us this

<p>Looking at the aerial images, we weren’t certain about the difficulty
in getting to Reed Island. The river was quite low on arrival and we
were able to carry our inflatable paddleboard out to a sandbar only a
few hundred yards from the western end of the island. The wind was low
and the current on this side of the island non-existent. It ended up
being a short and easily little paddle over to the island. Certainly
easier than steering a dugout canoe full of supplies a la Lewis and
Clark.</p>
<p>Once you get there – at least on the western end – there isn’t a lot
to do. We each took a turn making the short crossing as we had only
brought a single board. Both of us were barefoot from the paddleboard
and didn’t bring our shoes over so stamping around through the mucky
shore or the forested interior wasn’t much of an option. We each stayed
just long enough to enjoy being on an island in the middle of the great
Columbia River with the sun beating down and, importantly, the
grandparents watching the kids back in Seattle. In the hustle of our

<p>11am is not the time to arrive at Beacon Rock State Park on the first
sunny Saturday of spring. By this time, every adventurous Portlander or
Hood Riverite with a Subaru and Prana pants has already secured a spot
in the lower lot and was busy working their way up the hand holds on the
big rock. If you’ve read the earlier posts you know that this sort of
behavior – arriving late to a park – is out of character for us and, in
this case, purely an artifact of geography as we work our way through
many parks today.</p>

<p>That all said, we were able to snag one of the last remaining spots
at the upper Hamilton Mountain Trailhead. No time for a long hike, but
simply a short wander around the interpretive signage near the old CCC
constructed shelters. These old parks with the timber and stone
structures are my favorite, so much history and mature vegetation that
has reclaimed the grounds. Its a grand look; one befitting our state
parks.</p>
<p>By the time we left, the rangers had showed up to direct traffic –
mostly chase away latecomers to the party. I’d love to return and

<p>It amazes me that back in 1900 someone from the Spokane, Portland and
Seattle railway took a look at the canyon of the Klickitat River and
said, ‘Yep, let’s build a railroad in here’…all the way to Goldendale.
Completed in 1903 it was in use until 1980, so it appears to have been a
winning investment. Forty years later and thanks to a lot of hard work
by locals and the larger Rails-to-Trails program we are all now
beneficiaries of the flat, wide grade laid along this fast and sinuous
river.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_klickitattrail.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>The southernmost part of the trail beginning in Lyle, WA is the most
developed and, judging by the full parking lot likely the most used
section of the trail. Spandex, knobby tires and clip-in shoes were
everywhere. We, mere hikers, were the outliers. But our status didn’t
stop us from enjoying a sunny 40 minute walk up and back along the
trail.</p>
<p>The old rail bed is high above the rushing water below. A number of
homes are tucked in between the river and the trail giving one the sense
of walking right through their backyards. It is hard to imagine that
these homes were once that close to the rail line with trains flashing
by just tens of meters from their front doors. I would suspect cyclists
and dog walkers are in improvement over train horns and that
clickeddy-clack noise at all hours of the night, but not all owners may
like the new human company.</p>

<p>We entered the Columbia Gorge and turned west, following gravity’s

Highway, roughly following some portions of their eastward return route
from the sea. The signs denoting the Highway - and, by reference the

to the abundance of towns, counties, rivers and mountains with names
derived from the Native populations.</p>

<p>The wind blew steady out of the west, as is to be expected this time
of year. Still early, we found the trailhead at Horsethief Butte, in
Columbia Hills State Park, empty but for a two other cars. Judging by
the large foam mats that they were carrying on their backs, our company
on the trail was limited to a few early morning novice climbers heading
out to set up on the crags.</p>
<p>We were maybe a few weeks too soon for peak wildflowers; nonetheless,
a few early bloomers had pushed up through the dry and cracked ground.
We scrambled up to the top of the Butte, then down into a protected nook
where only the sun could get at us. A few minutes basking like lizards,
our zen moment interrupted by the train trucking past just a few hundred

<p>On a small plateau lies the town of Goldendale. Surrounded by
farmland, its downtown tells of a grander era when small family farmers
and the loggers spent their hard earned money at the local businesses
along Broadway Street. Starting in the 1970s a large aluminum plant
drove the local economy forward, but has since closed. What remains are
artifacts of this bygone era and a nearly ideal climate – sunny but not
as dry as the lower elevation areas along the river. The clear skies
here initially attracted some astronomers a century ago and today on a
hill above town lies the Goldendale Observatory.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for us, the Observatory is undergoing renovations and
is currently closed to the public. We drove up to the gate and parked.
The hill offers some great views and many hiking and mountain biking

<p>Aimed south, in the early morning we left the Yakima Valley on
Highway 97, headed for the Columbia Gorge. One quickly leaves the flat,
endless fields for rolling hills of sagebrush and thin barbed wire
fences. Little to no development or evidence of human presence in this
part of Tribal Lands. Eventually you pass up and over onto the south
face of the Simcoe Mountains. The vegetation grows arboreal and the
views open up, with the occasional sighting of Mt. Hood.</p>

<p>Soon after the change in the biome, we came upon Brooks Memorial.
Like Fort Simcoe, shuttered for the season. We stopped to do our duty in
making an official visit. The air was crisp, only a few degrees above
freezing. It is higher and colder here than you might think and the
reason for the winter closing showed its merit.</p>
<p>We didn’t stay long, many more parks awaited…and I wasn’t dressed for
the frost.</p>

<p><img src="waparks_files/figure-html/fort_simcoe-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>In our minds, Fort Simcoe was just outside of Yakima. In reality, it
is a 45-minute crawl through bottom of the Yakima valley. I say crawl,
because after you’ve spent 2 hours going nearly 80 mph on the freeway,
bumping along at 55 with frequent stop signs is. effectively, crawling.
But we were childless – the grandparents had the kids for two nights –
and had nowhere to be exactly. While the kids were, undoubtedly, waging
a war to stretch the boundaries of normal bedtimes and snack consumption
with the substitute parents, we worried little. Regardless of the
balance of power that was negotiated, all would survive the weekend
with, likely, few long term scars.<br />
<img src="images/waparks_fortsimcoe.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>The Yakima valley is irrigated farmland. Not the corn and wheat of my
native Midwest, but some fruit trees, vines and mostly hops. Miles and
miles of hop trellises, bereft of any plants this early but still
providing a hypnotic experience as you stare at the perfectly parallel
poles fly by the car window. This is also Yakama Nation territory; the
land use patterns suggesting that the normal market-driven,
county-planned approach doesn’t apply here. An odd mishmash of the
dominant agricultural producers and the residences of the native
population.</p>
<p>We drove on. The early evening sun casting a stark silhouette on
Mount Adams. Only a few wispy clouds hung in the sky, while the
thermometer read 65. Spring was here in the valley. We arrived to find
Fort Simcoe closed for the season. We knew this ahead of time, but this
was our chance to check this park off the list and we had to take it. I
captured the obligatory photo of the sign and we retreated to the car.
We paused for a bit to have a small picnic in the back of the Subaru.
Sun on our face, no small humans demanding things, few cares in the
world. We had missed the historical buildings of the park but had found
a moment of peace. A worthwhile trade in our book.</p>

<p>In our quest to date we had driven to, boated to and paddled to State
Parks. Willapa Hills was the first time we walked from one park to
another. Granted, it was just a short, flat half-mile hike from Rainbow
Falls, but an arrival by foot nonetheless.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_willapahills.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>One of five Rails-to-Trails projects that now serve as State Parks,
Willapa Hills Trail is connected to Rainbow Falls with what appears to
be a relatively recent trail addition. Recent, as evidenced by a
new-looking fence hacked through a farm field. Its a great feature as it
allows any long-distance biker or hikers on the trail easy access to the
camping facilities at the main park as well as providing a parking site
for would-be trail users.</p>
<p>Similar to our prior experience, we were the solitary visitors on
this segment of the Willapa Hills trail. Just the neighboring cattle and
a few soaring birds of prey for company. The adjacent landowner to the
north of where the connector trail joins the old rail line has used the
likely increase in visitors to show off their artwork. Artwork being an
oddly-staged dragon attacking an old rotting ship with numerous
mannequins and various other swap meet purchases thrown in for good
measure. Actually, artwork is too strong of a word. It’s more like
something a group of drunken college students would put together as a
joke entry into a parade. That, being weathered for a few years and
bereft of any form of maintenance or care. We only saw a small segment
of the park. I can only hope the rest is as filled with interesting
trail-side attractions. Short of that, I have little to report about
Willapa Hills Trail.</p>

<p>During my childhood there was a nearby waterpark named Rainbow Falls
(now defunct). At least once a summer we’d pack in the station wagon and
make a trip there to skin our knees on the bumpy water slides and
narrowly avoid catching some communicable disease in the tepid waters of
the lazy river. As a kid, these are trivial matters of course. The
opportunity to eat 1,000s of calories of processed sugars and act like a
savage for an afternoon far outweighed any health concerns.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_rainbowfalls.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>I couldn’t help but recall those days as we now, some 30 years later,
aimed our Subaru at the original (?) Rainbow Falls. True to form, it
rained the entire drive only for the clouds to part upon our arrival
and, lo and behold, a rainbow appear in the sky. A little magic on a wet
Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Unlike the waterpark of yesteryear, this parking lot was empty.
Totally empty. We had the run of the place. A short hike down to the
river and the eponymous falls revealed a small cataract of rushing water
and the remnants of the old bridge that once crossed here. Shaded out by
the overhanging trees it was too dark and damp of a spot for a morning
picnic, but worth the rock scramble down nonetheless.</p>

<p>A stop on the historic northern spur of the Oregon trail, Lewis and
Clark State Park is a dendrophiliac’s dream. Thick stands of remnant old
growth forest. Miles of hiking trails, massive nurse logs and heaping
ferns. Towering conifers and crooked deciduous varieties. Wetlands and
meadows and more.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_lewisandclark.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>All of these things were denied us. The park was closed, not to open
again until May 1. An odd closure for certain given the temperate
climate in this part of the state. Luckily this park was more-or-less on
our way back to our lodging so nothing much lost in the way of travel.
Additionally, the rain had finally caught up to us as well and no sooner
than we arrived at the shuttered gate that the sky opened up and water
fell in a drenching cadence.</p>
<p>A disappointing end to the day, no doubt, but it did save us the
grind of a somewhat forced hike through the soggy ground amidst a
substantial late winter rain. And, it could have been worse, after all.
We could have been arriving in a covered wagon subsisting on old leather
and rose hips and suffering from dysentery. A little perspective goes a
long way at times. Next up, take out food and the hotel pool.</p>

<p>We spent most of January and February locked down letting the worst
of the weather and the pandemic pass before resuming our State Parks
quest. It felt good to be back on the road, searching for those large
brown signs beyond which lay beaches and trails, interpretive signage
and parking lots, playgrounds and picnic shelters.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_ikekinswa.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Ike Kinswa park occupies a sharp peninsula that juts out into
Mayfield Lake. Formerly a high ridge between the confluence of the
Tilton and Cowlitz rivers, the construction of the Mayfield Dam in 1963
turned this upland into a lowland. Soon after, the park was renamed from
Mayfield Lake to Ike Kinswa to honor a local member of the Cowlitz
tribe, prominent in the 1880s.</p>
<p>A handful of RVs were sited in the one section of the park’s
campground that wasn’t closed for the season. A dog walker here and a
few others milling about over there. The standard off season emptiness
of a State Park far from a population center.</p>
<p>A short hike took us to the end of the peninsula and a few small
beaches. As we threw rocks into the water, a fishing boat glided by. At
the same time our eldest found some discarded fishing line, complete
with swivel and leaded weight (sinker). For a good, long moment I was
transported back to my youth. Countless weekends in a similar boat,
casting similar lines in a similar lake. Fighting the cold breeze and
the glare of the sun off the wave-tinted water. The occasional sun burn,
the more occasional cold fingers and toes. String cheese and pretzels
for snacks, a Pepsi or root beer to drink. The smell of dead bait and
marine fuel at times, dying algae at others. Sometimes the fish were
biting, often they were not. Grand old times with my dad and brother. A
lifetime ago; a half continent away.</p>
<p>We hiked out and over to another part of the park where mom led a
small nature school. Class consisted of identifying various seed and
cones while splayed out on a large rock to soak up a short sunburst. The
skies to the west began to threaten and we soon packed up headed back to
civilization, or Chehalis at the very least.</p>

<p>From the border, we meandered southwards along the coast. First
through downtown Blaine looking more desolate than most towns due to the
decreased border traffic. Then down past the seaside community of Birch
Bay which was livelier than expected on a blustery winter day. Likely
many owners had retreated to their seaside cabins for the holiday as
most large family gathering had been canceled. Eventually we arrived at
Birch Bay State Park. Like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Btfsplk">Joe Btfslpk</a> the
clouds followed us down to the beach as well.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_birchbay.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>The wide, broad beach was hemmed in by the high winter tide.
Childless, we parked and were quickly be on our way for a short hike
along the water. No collecting snacks and water bottles, no zipping
jackets and tightening hats. No whining. Just two adults out for a
stroll along the ocean; our conversation focused mostly around planning
for the new year and how we’ll try to keep checking off parks through
coming few wet and cold months.</p>
<p>Back on the road as we had a ferry to catch. Our childcare hadn’t
agreed to an overnight session, unfortunately, and the only un-visited
parks nearby required a boat to get to. Birch Bay is almost certainly a
better visit in the summer; today’s stop didn’t do it justice.</p>

<p>All around us the skies were clearing, the sun peaking through on a
chilled Tuesday late in December. Except here. Here above this muddy
field the low clouds held tight and the wind blew in off the water. Over
the past few weeks the rains had softened the ground while the
abnormally high foot traffic turning it to an oozing mess. We were in
this field because it is one of the 137 state parks that we are on a
quest to visit. Most of the others were here – Peace Arch State Park –
because it is one of (the only?) place where Canadians and Americans can
physically gather during the pandemic.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_peacearch.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>And gather they did. Many for picnics, some just stomping through the
mud and conversing, others engaged in more intimate exchanges in the
dozens of tents set up across the higher ground. Outliers, we had come
for the park not the people and for that, our visit was short. A quick
wander to stare up at the actual Peach Arch then a lap of the
aforementioned mud pit on the American side. A walk that took us past
multiple border agents of both nations and likely dozens of hidden
cameras.</p>
<p>Pandemic-version Peace Arch is a unique scene and certainly the most
‘COVID-specific’ thing we’ve seen in the nearly 90 parks visited to
date. A geo-political oddity serving a necessary function – that of
maintaining human connection – in a time of exceptional trying. We left
with wet feet and muddy pants but also a renewed sense of hope for what
cooperation and good intent might be able to accomplish in 2021.</p>

Sylvia</a>:</h4>
<p>   </p>
<p><img src="waparks_files/figure-html/lake_silvia-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Entering Montesano we came upon a train derailment, the first of our
State Park Challenge. This is big excitement for a four-year-old. We
slowly took the marked detour, speculating widely on what had happened
(six grain cars derailed due to a wash out of the tracks). No matter the
quality of Lake Sylvia Park, it was likely to be a disappointment to at
least one of us.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_lakesylvia.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Up the winding road and perched above Montesano is Lake Sylvia Park.
The lake is an artificial one, created by the damming of Sylvia Creek
right above the natural waterfall. Back in the 1880s a homesteading
family settled here, built a dam to power a sawmill and raised a family
of 13 children on the property. While trying to keep our two children
from falling into the water or eating wild mushrooms, the enormity of
that task settled uncomfortably on us…though I guess they start to watch
each other at some point. I can only imagine the fun those kids had at
having their very own lake to fish and swim in, provided late 19th
century frontier life left any time for leisurely pursuits such as
this.</p>
<p>We learned about this family and more during our short hike up and
over the dam and through the surrounding forest. Many more miles of
trails radiate from this park – down to town, up to the national forest
and in every other direction. The park was busy, mostly with solo dog
walker and hikers. We were the only group with kids (the playground is
closed for COVID and swimming obviously out of season). We wondered
about the uses of the very new building on the SE shore, but did not put
in the effort of checking it out in person. Based on the parking, the
signage and the built features, it seems Lake Sylvia is a popular summer
hang out for Montesanoans (?).</p>

<p>There is no easy way to get from Hoodsport to Schafer State Park. The
winding route of third-rate state highways and other back roads is, most
certainly, a road less traveled. Along the way one passes a dizzying
menagerie of land uses – an airport, a prison, a church, a lakeside
development that, apparently, requires broken-down RVs in the by-laws,
tree farms and horse barns, logged areas and wild woods, fireworks
stands, a mini-mart and a fish hatchery. Its a whirlwind tour of the
wilder (weirder) side of Mason County. Being a weekday, we also
encountered some road construction, our presence at which surprised the
workers clearly who hadn’t expected any civilian vehicles and had
neither signs nor flag people. An odd 22 miles to say the least.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_schafer.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Schafer State Park sits riverside, down in a hollow. Our thermometer
registered 32, it felt colder. The damp fog was lifting, leaving behind
a crystalline frost on everything. The standard hiking trail next to the
raging river we deemed too risky given our wandering and fancy free tiny
people. Instead, went for a short hike through the open campground area
– an area that looked more like the remnants of a clear cut than a
welcoming place to pitch a tent. Some maintenance seemed in order as the
sturdy stone buildings near the parking lot had seen better days. One
had boarded up windows and a variety of detritus laying about. It wasn’t
entirely clear if we had wandered off of park property or not.</p>
<p>It will come as no surprise that we were one of only two cars in the
lot. A frigid Tuesday morning in December is not high season around
here. All these factors together with the requisite COVID signage and
‘closed’ signs put off a aura of desolation, of forgotten-ness, of
irrelevance; however, we were too cold to philosophize about its deeper
meaning for too long and quickly made our exit.</p>

<p>The forecast had promised clear skies in the afternoon. The fog had
other ideas and hung on in a patchy manner until sunset. The fickle fog
drifted in and out over Potlatch State Park during our visit, offering
windows of gorgeous views out over the Hood Canal as well as chilling,
dark periods of an almost wet mist. Par for the course during the
‘wet’.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_potlatch.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Potlatch is your standard ocean-front State Park. A public access
beach and picnic area on the water side of the highway, with camping
tucked in across the road in the higher elevations. It is a useful
template that separates day use from the campers and allows for maximal
public space near the water. It is also tends to blur one’s memories of
the parks given their similar design and appearance…unless that is just
my advanced age beginning to show.</p>
<p>Its unique attributes kept us busy for the afternoon. The new
interpretative trail along the forested northern boundary captures a
surprisingly large variety of native plant life given its short length,
including nearly every berry we don’t want the kids to eat as well as
various mushrooms that had randomly colonized the area. To the kids it
may have sounded like the trail of death, or perhaps, a walk entitled
“How the forest can kill you”. Away from the poison plants, we found a
large spiral design that someone had created out of oyster shells. It is
possible it was sacred pagan art related to yesterday’s winter solstice.
Either way, it is unlikely that an explanation of such would have
deterred our children from treating it as a race course and we let them
frolic atop it liberally, provided that we fix and then expand the
project before we left. Content that we had done our part to add just a
little bit more art to the world – and not anger the local spirits – we
packed up and headed back to our rented home in Hoodsport.</p>

<p>Triton Cove State Park is a very large boat launch and parking lot
with an equally small beach area attached. It is very well maintained
and likely a wonderful resource for the boating community along this
stretch of the Hood Canal. It is not, however, the type of park that
will still your soul nor that warrants removing the children from their
car seats. Our stop here was a more of a drive through, high tide having
obscured most of the beach anyways. We took in the sights – severely
limited by the lingering fog – and noted the clean looking toilets in
case of future needs along this stretch of Highway 101.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_tritoncove.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>With the time saved from our short Triton Cove visit, we added a stop
at <a href="https://hamahamaoysters.com/">Hama Hama Oysters &amp; Tree
Farm</a>. The kids enjoyed climbing the hills of oyster shells and
stalking the resident waterfowl across the grounds. For the adults it
was chowder and smoked salmon pate. While COVID hasn’t been kind to any
businesses rely on food provision, Hama Hama’s outdoor dining setup
suggested they had adapted just fine to social distancing requirements.
Yes, you can’t enjoy your soup in the warm confines of their cozy
headquarters but you can eat in an A-frame built atop discarded bi-valve
remains. The new experience seems a bit more authentic to me. The fare,
by the way, is as good as ever.</p>
<p>Earlier in our state parks quest we may have opted to take our Hama
Hama order to Triton Cove for a picnic in order to make a more
substantial ‘visit’ of the park. As our quest has progressed, we’ve
become more pragmatic. It was cold, we were hungry, one child was
running on a single sock and the clock was edging toward nap time.
Prudence won out and, for that, we feel no shame.</p>

<p>Fresh off our very short visit to Pleasant Harbor we arrived at
Dosewallips State Park ready to get out and move around. The recent
rains had left the lawns pockmarked with puddles; the cold front that
moved in over night had added thin geometric patterns of ice floating
atop. Smashing these would prove a favored task of both children.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_dosewallips.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>The lower part of the park encompasses the majority of the
delta/estuary of the Dosewallips River. Overnight, the cold air had sunk
down and sat in these wetlands coating the plants with a brilliant
veneer of frost. Hardly the winter wonderland of my Midwestern
upbringing, glints of sun poking through the fog occasionally danced off
of the frost giving us some of the pre-Christmas feel that is so often
absent here in the wet and dreary PNW. The trail out to the delta’s far
reaches is well-built but was flooded nonetheless given the yesterday’s
torrent. We skirted, hopped and sidestepped most of the problem areas
though eventually were blocked off as it was high tide and the rushing
river had been pushed back across the normal route.</p>
<p>Retreating to the raised platform, we found it a great perch to watch
the eagles roasting in the dead trees and the ducks going about their
daily routines. Frost had also settled on the platform floor, causing a
number of close calls from the adults and one epic wipe-out from the
youngest. Only one handful of trail snacks were harmed in this incident.
We hustled back through the gauntlet of puddles to the car as the
near-freezing fog had chilled us to the bone. En route, one boat was
submerged and one diaper filled; the scene back at the car – a frantic
search for new socks and baby wipes amidst pleas for more snacks – was
chaotic, for sure, but nothing outside of our our standard road trip
melee. The new normal.</p>

<p>For 24 hours it had rained, and rained hard. Here at our Airbnb in
Hoodsport – near that drastic bend in the Hood Canal, the far SW of
Puget Sound – me missed out on the snow that eventually fell and
accumulated in Seattle and northwards. Instead, we awoke to a cold and
blanketing fog with the temperature hovering right around freezing. It
was deathly still, a welcome calm from the winds earlier in the
week.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_pleasantharbor.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>North of Hoodsport Highway 101 hugs the coastline, often with a steep
hillside on your left and the beach on your right; the roadway forced
into what space it could. After a storm like this one countless
impromptu waterfalls dumped runoff on the road and in the nearby ditch.
A dozen or so recent and small landslides were visible as well. Many had
been stopped by well-placed barriers but one had spilled onto the road
and had required an early morning removal session by the local highway
department. Mornings like these are a reminder of the constant battle
that is waged to keep our roadways intact against Mother’s Nature’s
continual barrage of wind and water.</p>
<p>Pleasant Harbor looked small on the map and, not being in a boat, we
came in with low expectations. First we turned too early, into the local
marina. Then we turned too late and had to backtrack. The entrance to
the park is not signed at all. Eventually, we found ourselves on a steep
and poorly maintained one-lane road switch-backing toward the bay. And
by one-lane I mean there is absolutely no way for cars to pass each
other; a meeting would require someone to back all the way out. We
arrived to find that the park was nothing more than two parking spots, a
portable toilet and a dock. Both spots were, oddly enough, full so we
had to pull a U-turn in the neighboring marina’s overflow lot and wait
out the other two adventurers. Soon enough we were able to grab our
requisite photo of the signage. This park is a well-kept secret, though
a secret you shouldn’t be too upset about not being in on.</p>

torpedo tower). It has, mostly, returned to its wild self.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_forttownsend.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>We arrived around 3:30; late afternoon here in the Pacific Northwest.
We hustled down the trail to the beach and out along it to the
north/northwest. About a 1/2 mile from the parking lot one comes across
some of the largest driftwood we’ve ever seen. Massive old growth logs
that had been sawed at both ends, likely escapees that were once headed
for a local sawmill. They look to have been here for a century, maybe
longer. Once again, a sad reminder of what our entire region looked like
before the arrival of European saws. Looking out over the water from
here quickly reminds you of the modern world; however. From west to
east: The Port Townsend Paper Mill, ferries docking in Port Townsend
along with the city itself, and then the glaring lights of the currently
active naval base on Indian Island. It is a great vantage point for
taking in all the activity around the bay.</p>
<p>As the tide receded, a sandy/mucky beach emerged. Just the right
consistency for the kids to march around in making suction noises and
leaving well preserved footprints. Our goal here was exhaustion. We’ve
spent a fair bit of time in the car on this trip and needed to fully
wear the kids out today so they’ll sleep tonight. We returned whence we
came, leaving the park at dusk just as the rangers were locking up for
the night.</p>

<p>While the kids napped, I made a mad dash to Anderson Lake State Park
to check this off our list. Flying solo here turned out to be a wise
decision. A toxic algae bloom had closed the lake, the beach and the
waterfront trail to visitors. The standard entrance road and parking lot
was gated off as well, though visitors were allowed to park at the upper
lot near the road. A lot that was surprisingly busy.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_andersonlake.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Removing the lake and its accessories, Anderson Lake State Park is
just a collection of trails through the woods. I chose one and took off
for a short trail run. On account of last week’s storms, it became more
of a steeplechase – dodging puddles and leaping downed trees. Rounding a
tight corner I quickly came upon a solitary man. The look on his face
suggested that I had caught him in some illegal act – or perhaps he was
just startled. A smile and a wave on my part did not lighten his
paranoid scowl and somewhat menacing mood. Though he was not visibly
armed, I was glad that I was moving quickly and soon put him far behind.
Soon at the car, I headed back to get the family for one more state park
visit this afternoon.</p>

<p>Our past travels have included Fort Worden and Fort Casey; only Fort
Flagler remained from the original <a
href="https://www.historylink.org/File/7524">Triangle of Fire</a> – the
three heavily-armed defensive fortifications originally built to protect
Puget Sound. We arrived to steel gray skies and just enough wind to be
uncomfortable in the 40 degree weather. Intent on heading straight to
the battlements, ambiguous signage lead us astray, down to a small
parking lot in the far southeast of the park. We followed this up with
another mis-direction that landed us at the beach. We decided to stay
here for a bit before working our way back up to the main attractions on
the bluff.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_fortflagler.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Exiting the car at the lonely beach parking lot, we were greeted by
the smell of something dead and by the sight and sound of dozens of sea
birds. A large, decaying humpback whale carcass – as the sign informed
us – lay not far away on the beach. It had been a few days, at minimum,
since it had washed up and by now was mostly a large pile of blubber.
The scavengers did not appreciate our presence. Nor did the sea lion
patrolling off-shore not far away. On account of the cold weather and
cold welcome, we retreated to the human designated area of the beach til
the wind drove us back to the car and, finally, down the correct road to
the parking lot for the fortifications.</p>
<p>The batteries here are both less numerous and less decayed than those
at Fort Worden. Their design is notably different as well, with greater
exposure of the lower levels. Due to the improved lighting and overall
cleanliness, the creepiness factor is much lower here; though, the
experience still well worth the visit. All told, Fort Worden has a bit
more to offer in terms of the beach, the old buildings and the
fortifications, though Fort Flagler isn’t far behind and seems less
visited as well. As we finished our snack atop a concrete pad that once
held a massive rotary gun, the rain began. We raced back to the car and,
from there, to our accommodations in Port Townsend. Three parks down
this morning, two more to go in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Kinney Point park, though conveniently located, is not very
accessible. Physically getting into it requires a bit of ingenuity and a
bit more grit. We had the necessary ingredients, though when spread over
a crew of four they can get a bit thin. So, we decided to divide and
conquer here. One of us would take on Kinney Point solo while the other
hustled the two junior members up to Mystery Bay. It was our first
parallel park experience.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_kinneypoint.png" style="width:15%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_mysterybay.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>The trail to Kinney Point isn’t on the map. Nor is it well worn or
signed. The grasses, brambles, saplings and various other vegetation
impeding the trail were wet from last night’s rain. The tide was high,
further complicating the process. Pants and shoes were quickly soaked
making for a cold adventurer. A early fork in the path took one of us
farther inland than we would have liked, but did ensure we were on park
grounds. Meanwhile, the Mystery Bay crew rolled into this tiny park just
a few short minutes after our drop-off. The smallest of the group was
underwhelmed by the scenery on Marrowstone Island and had fallen asleep.
Probably for the best as there isn’t much going on at Mystery Bay. A
boat launch, a dock and a small beach. Including the homes surrounding
the bay, we were the only people in sight. A small apple tree saved the
day, providing enough ammunition to keep us busy throwing small apples
into the water to ‘feed the fish’.</p>
<p>We then message of success came through from the Kinney Point party,
those at Mystery Bay quickly packed up and raced backed to the
rendezvous point. Our timing was solid and soon we were a party of four
again. Neither park, as we visited them, provided much reward, though
the level of efforts varied widely.</p>

<p>Of all the parks we had visited before starting this challenge, Fort
Worden was the one I most looked forward to returning to. I’m not sure
what second place would be, maybe Deception Pass or Mount Pilchuck, but
they are certainly a distant second. The old buildings, the bunkers, the
beach; Fort Worden truly has it all.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_fortworden.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>The clouds had begun to break up and the sun shone through as we
arrived, just in time for our lunch on the old parade grounds. As we
ate, remote control airplane hobbyists kept the kids enthralled as we
plotted out our path through the park’s many highlights. First up the
hill for a bit of steep hike to the line of old batteries at the top of
the bluff. Exploring the dark narrow tunnels isn’t the same with kids –
especially with one in a child-carrying backpack – though still pretty
amazing. So very odd to think about the hustle and bustle of soldiers
that once lived among this park and trained on the battlements daily.
They spend days, weeks, months of their lives in these tunnels. All the
preparation for the enemy ships that, thankfully, never came.</p>
<p>After the requisite loop through the fortifications – including a
stop at Battery Tolles where us adults had never been – we descended to
the beach. By this point the sky had fully cleared and it was nearing 50
degrees. The glorious afternoon brought most of the locals out to the
park and the beach was busy, relatively speaking. Inspired by the day’s
visit, the kids built a fort of their own from driftwood and bull kelp,
the elder one constructing, the younger one getting in the way. Like so
many other parks of military origin in and around urban areas their
lasting legacy will likely be one of preservation of public open space
and not tactical defense. I doubt the original designers and builders of
these forts envisioned happy vacationing families, interpretive signage,
weddings and kayak rentals. But I bet they’d be happier with the end
result.</p>

<p>We’ve had some good luck over the course of our State Parks travels
to date. Well-timed visits, minimal disruptions and disasters and no
injuries to speak of. Usually, we plan well but this was a bit of
last-minute trip with some details left to chance. Like Kitsap Memorial
a few miles back, we had planned to walk the beaches of Shine Tidelands
park. The name would suggest this is the defining feature here. Turns
out it is the only feature.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_shinetidelands.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>The very high tide limited our use of the park considerably, poor
timing on our part. We were left with a foot of rapidly disappearing
beach, the badly potholed gravel parking lot and two lonesome picnic
tables. A fisherman cast into the water nearby. Large trucks rattled the
Hood Canal bridge, just a few hundred feet away. The gray sky hung low,
merging with the water in the distance. The scene quickly drained the
excitement from our party. Snacks were the only thing that could save
the situation. We plied them liberally.</p>
<p>After a bit of stick and rock throwing we exited back down the narrow
drive. Later, we would find out that we could have driven down to the
other parking area which may of provided a better beach and more hiking.
The entire areas is rather poorly signed, perhaps on purpose as there
are privately owned tidelands here as well and, being a rather fragile
environment, it might be best to keep the hoards of shellfish collectors
away via confusion and uncertainty. This is our 75th park and possibly
the least developed of them to date, barring those that are islands.</p>

<p>Our weekend on the Peninsula began with a stop at Kitsap Memorial
State Park, the first of many parks for this trip. For months we’ve eyed
the eight closely packed parks on and around Port Townsend, excited
about how quickly a trip here would bump our visited park number with
minimal effort (hours in the car with kids). As a bonus, we also
thoroughly enjoy Port Townsend as a destination in and of itself. The
hardest part of the planning has been in finding lodging. That secured,
we were on an early morning ferry bound for Bainbridge.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_kitsapmemorial.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>We had planned on exploring the beach at Kitsap Memorial. We had not
planned on arriving during a +10 tide, which, here, means no beach at
all. Where Mother Nature had taketh, she also giveth in the form of a
storm a few nights ago that had left countless fir branches scattered
about the park. We sent all the boys – the author included – to gather
them up while Mom constructed a small shelter from our findings. Our
kids love being outside, love dragging things around and, occasionally,
love being helpful. All parties were happy with how this visit ended up;
perhaps none more than the park rangers who were spared the post-storm
cleanup.</p>
<p>It was a cold, November morning and the emptiness of the park wasn’t
necessarily a surprise. The taped-off playground, mostly empty campsites
and shuttered and signed historic buildings (often the location of
joyous weddings and family gatherings) here were a glaring reminder of
the pandemic. It is going to be a long winter, I fear. I hope we can
keep up our motivation around bundling up and getting outside in the
misty, low-40 degree weather we can expect from now until March
(June?).</p>

<p>Bridle Trails is one of the closet parks to our home; however, we’d
been saving it for a cold winter weekend when it could be paired with
other errands around town. Translation: We had low expectations and were
not going to make a special trip of it. Our pre-visit preparation – a
quick look at an aerial image – revealed a large gravel parking lot, a
variety of equestrian-related structures and power-lines running through
the forest. Not being horse-people, the primary focus of the park seemed
lost on us. Hopefully the forest would deliver. Arriving mid-morning,
later than normal our team, we found the parking lot filling.
Four-legged creatures abounded; dogs not horses.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_bridletrails.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>We wandered. First through the equestrian facilities, soggy and
vacant. Perhaps it was the cold weather or COVID which kept the horses
away. To be honest, it’s not clear how often these training and
showcasing facilities are used today. Urban development has surrounded
the park, likely robbing it of many of its neighboring riders.
Everything appeared in working order, but the well-attended events shown
on the signage were decades old. If this was a typical weekend, the
chaps and boots crowd had given way to yoga pants and New Balances.</p>
<p>We headed down a trail in search of the old-growth trees promised by
the trailhead map. It ended up being too far for the little legs in the
group, but we did enjoy the wide flat trails lined with moss-covered
trees and coated with big-leaf maple fallings as big as one’s head.
Bridle Trails wasn’t what exactly we expected but it was a fine walk in
the woods and that was OK by us.</p>

<p>With the morning’s mechanical delays, our time at Rasar needed to be
short and sweet in order to make our boat. We all piled out of the car
for requisite bathrooms runs and diaper changes before sitting down for
a picnic in the long, soft grass. Leaves the size of our heads gently
drifted down from the big leaf maples surrounding the day use area. No
views from here, but a pleasant mix of sunshine and shade. Hints of
autumn’s pending arrival all around.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_rasar.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Sated, we headed out for a quick hike; a much needed stretching of
the legs after the three-hour drive from Twisp. We took the nearest
trail down the hill and out into the flat floodplain of the Skagit
River. Oddly placed directly in the middle of a large meadow is a single
picnic table and large, interpretive sign. Expecting some explanation of
riverine action or fluvial dynamics on the sign, I was surprised to find
that it contained a short anecdote about an experience a ranger had with
a threatening bull elk near this very spot. I guess its intent was to
serve as a warning to future hikers. Or maybe to call our attention to
the wonders of elk mating habits. It is really hard to say. After
looking at my fair share of signage at the previous 71 state parks, this
certainly qualifies as the oddest.</p>
<p>While I scanned the horizon for angry ungulates, the eldest picked
dandelions and braided them into small ropes. The younger child was
testing out various ways to injure himself on the picnic table;
fortunately a failed endeavor. The only sounds were the distant rush of
the river and the occasional crow flying over head. For a minute, it was
relaxing. Then the clock called and we had to pack up and hit the road
again bound for Anacortes. Our ferry ended up being delayed and our rush
was for naught. Considering we began the day with three functioning
tires and no electricity, you’ll hear no complaints about a bit of a
wait at the ferry dock.</p>

<p>The kids slept through the night in our small hotel room in Winthrop
and we all woke refreshed for another day on the road. This one our last
of the trip. Unfortunately, our morning would deteriorate. Returning
from a morning run along the Methow River, I noticed that we had a flat
tire. This was the first vehicular issue of the trip, nearly 4,000 miles
into our Parks Challenge. Returning to the hotel room to convey the bad
news, I wasn’t the only one with something to share. The power had gone
out in the hotel and, according to the front desk, in all of Methow
Valley. A call to Les Schwab in Twisp confirmed that they had time to
fix our tire but could only do so if the power returned. We faced the
possibility of spending more time here than originally planned.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_rockport.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>It wasn’t the missed ferry reservation or the need to entertain the
kids while at the repair shop that bothered us. No, our fear and
loathing was precipitated by the possibility of a mis-alignment between
the longer mountain crossing and the children’s naps. The nap schedule
(read: our two hours of sanity) drove our trip planning and that now was
threatened. After a quick consultation with our owner’s manual I was
able to put the spare tire on; enough to get us to the mechanic. Off we
went, 10 miles in the wrong direction hoping the power would return.
Luckily it had and after an hour we had a patched tire and were on our
way back west on Highway 20. With any luck we’d still make our 3:05
ferry.</p>
<p>Our original plan had been a picnic lunch at Rockport State Park. The
kids were still sleeping so we opted for a slow roll through the park,
awing at the big trees and fall colors. The car never stopping so as to
keep the backseat passengers asleep. Forty-five minutes earlier at a
lookout over Ross Lake, we pulled a similar maneuver where one of us
jumped out of the moving vehicle for a quick bathroom run while the
other drove circles in the parking lot. Foregoing a hike through the old
growth at Rockport was a missed opportunity, but given our morning if
that is all we had to forfeit on we’ll consider the day salvaged.</p>

<p>Judging from the size of the parking lot, Pearrygin Lake State Park
can get busy. Lucky for us on this gorgeous weekday afternoon in October
our fellow patrons only numbered in the dozens. We easily found a prime
beach spot that allowed for both direct water access and enough shade.
After three or four trips back and forth from the car we had all of our
necessities and could settle in for an afternoon at the lake. While we
had plenty of experience on the road by now and had been developing
little systems to help simplify the process of traveling with kids, rare
is the occasion that a followup trip to get the missing this or that
isn’t needed. No amount of organizing or preparation seems to be able to
allow one to run contrary to this Law of Parenting.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_pearryginlake.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>The water appeared inviting and I was sweating from all the
retrieving. Looks, however, can be deceiving. The chilly autumn evenings
kept the lake temperature down and my swim was quickly aborted. Even the
kids kept to knee deep or less in the cold water. We mostly collected
sticks and rocks to build little beach structures and tried to keep the
little one from destroying the big one’s creations. A pretty standard
day at the beach.</p>
<p>Over the afternoon the beach slowly filled in. A few paddleboarders,
another family that also appeared a bit weary from the journey here and
a number of dog walkers. A single jet ski tore around the lake,
interrupting our peace and quiet (Note: I used this term lightly given
we have a toddler). No one else went for a swim, confirming to me that I
wasn’t just wimpy and that the water was actually too cold for sustained
submersion.</p>

<p>Exiting Highway 17 towards Bridgeport State Park you leave the

On your left as far as the eye can see is the olive green of the thinly
scattered desert vegetation. On your right the massive Chief Joseph Dam;
the water churning, the power lines humming. It is sparse out here. No
people or moving vehicles in sight. The river pushes on toward the sea,
slowing briefly for these annoyances that man has put in its way.
Continuing on Half Sun Way, up and over a small rise and the dam and its
accessories recede from view. Burnt hills arise in the distance. A few
birds of prey hang in the thermals rising from the land heating in the
bright mid-morning sun. Passing through the abandoned Lake Woods Golf
Course on the river side adds to the feeling of desolation.</p>

<p>Honestly, the drive in had lowered our expectations for the park.
Just another one to cross off of the list. Well, actually not just
another one. Bridgeport would mark the halfway point of our State Parks
Challenge. For six of the past nine months (minus a 3-month COVID break)
we’ve been dipping our toes at beaches and scouting campsites all over
the state. Consulting our trusty gazetteer (and Google Maps) to plot
routes to best align with nap schedules. And, most importantly, stocking
up on snacks to help manage the emotions of all members of our intrepid
party. In doing so we’ve driven the equivalent of Seattle to Key West,
crossing the Cascades eight times, the Columbia River six. Setting foot
in 24 counties and on 18 different islands. We were hoping for a joyous
park experience to mark our progress.</p>
<p>Arriving a Bridgeport we were so pleased to have been utterly wrong
in our initial inference. The autumn colors here shown bright, the lawn
well manicured, and the park empty. Other than a few remaining RVs we
had the entire park to ourselves, much more space that we could ever
hope to use. It was late enough in the morning that a swim would have
been refreshing not chilling, but the large sign warning of toxic algae
kept us out of the water. We explored the grounds freely, the kids
excited at having the large playground to themselves, us adults noting
the amazing views of the Columbia from the walk-in campsites. We managed
a short hike up the interpretative trail before returning to quell the
hunger complaints from some of our party. Having lunched, we piled back
in the car for the drive up the Methow Valley. Bridgeport is a wonderful
park set amidst the lonesome shore of the Columbia River; a fitting
marker of our progress.</p>

<p>On a calm, October Monday morning Alta Lake lay still. A single
aluminum fishing craft trolling so slowly its wake didn’t upset the pane
glass texture of the water. The parking lot was no busier. No bodies at
the beach, the concession stand locked up for the season. After spending
the weekend at Lake Chelan, the emptiness here was welcome.</p>

<p>Burn scars from the 2014 fire still show on the larger remaining
trees. The vegetation is mostly quick growing, post-fire plants. The
cold nights have turned the leaves all shades of vibrant colors, the
reds and yellow striking against the pure blue water and the irrigated
greens of the parks lawns. Around this natural palette brown hills form
a bounding ring. Lest I wax too poetically about the natural scenery
here, do note that much of the shoreline is privately owned and filled
with modern homes, docks and boats.</p>
<p>This early in the day it was too cold for a swim. We settled for a
short hike to see the ghost trees down by the NW end of the lake and
then spent a long episode at the swing set – which appeared to be the
only playground equipment to have survived the fire. A simple design
from generations ago – wrought iron, now rusted –it may have survived
the past few fires. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if it was there
when the first European settlers stumbled up the rim and looked down

adult interaction paired with snacks and videos, hence my position in
the back seat.</p>

<p>Where Twenty-Five Mile Creek was mostly a camping and boating crowd –
and a small one at that – Lake Chelan was filled with day users and RVs.
With a playground, larger beach and a store, it is a bigger draw than
Twenty-Five Mile Creek, not to mention closer to town. As a result, it
was also much more crowded, though not uncomfortably so. Big groups
abounded without a single mask to be seen. A time traveler from the deep
past (say February 2020), would have had no idea we were amidst a
pandemic; one currently affecting our highest levels of government.<a

<p>We didn’t stay long. A quick trip to the beach to dip our toes and
then a few runs down the slide and off we went. I returned to the center
rear seat for the 30-minute ride to our rental home. Our place on Wapato
Point was a mere 1.4 miles across the water, but 20-some miles by road
and, thus, around the lake we drove. Uncomfortable as it maybe, the rear
seat does afford one the opportunity to selectively filter the chocolate
pieces from the trail mix without your spouse knowing, so it isn’t all
bad.</p>

<p>Six highways, three passes, five stoplights, one pit stop and 196
miles later we arrived at Twenty-Five Mile Creek State Park. On its own,
it is not a destination worth a journey of that magnitude, but we were
making a weekend of it in Chelan so, in truth, getting here was only a
minor detour.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_twentyfivemilecreek.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Dominating the waterfront is the marina, oddly empty this gorgeous
October weekend. A small beach rests inside of the moorage. So well
cordoned off is the marina that the water inside its confines is
algae-laden and discolored, a sharp contrast to the signature crystal
clear water of the rest of the Lake Chelan. A smell wafted from the
water, eerily reminiscent of the late summer lakes of my northern
Wisconsin youth. A walk to the end of the concrete pier/breakwater will
get you past the smell and out to a full, wide view across the lake.
This far up – nearly 1/3 of the way from the southern most point where
the Chelan River exits – you can look out across and see no human
development at all. Just a few sparse trees dotting the brown hills that
dive straight into the water. It is a side of Lake Chelan that few
likely get to see.</p>
<p>Next to the marina is the creek. A small water course with driftwood
and bubbling falls, its a better place to spend an afternoon – for
adults and children alike – than the lakeside beach. While our attempt
at building a beaver dam was ultimately unsuccessful, we did manage to
escape with only a few bumps and bruises. Not an easy feat for two small
children amidst slick rocks and sharp sticks. Upstream from our failed
hydro project, we found a school of small sockeye salmon working their
way slowly up the creek to spawn. Too tired to hide, they allowed us to
get close enough to nearly touch. We left them to their timeless journey
and us to ours. A quick snack and repack of the car and we were on our
way.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>To this point we had driven some 3,500 miles on our Parks Challenge
without any major incidents. No accidents, no flat tires, our boat never
ran aground, our paddleboards never tipped. No altercations with locals,
no harassment by or of wild animals and no visits from law enforcement.
Just a few miles south of Bay View State Park we stained our perfect
record. One of us mentioned to the other that we appeared to be gaining
on a motorcycle that may have been a police vehicle. Shortly thereafter
we were pulled over for speeding through the small town of Bay View. A
mask covered the smug grin on the passenger’s face.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_bayview.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>The driver’s (who shall remain nameless) previously unblemished
record may have resulted in us getting off with a warning. Our biggest
concern was that our four-year-old – who has taken to calling out speed
limits sign whenever he sees them – was going to tattle on us to the
highway patrolman regarding our conversation about knowingly speeding
prior to the incident. He kept quiet, likely transfixed by the flashing
lights at our immediate rear.</p>
<p>Brush with the law over, we slowly pulled in and parked at Bay View
State Park. The non-camping area is compact, but with a pleasant beach.
The view of the bay is dominated by the Tesoro Refinery which steals no
small amount of charm from what was once idyllic Padilla Bay. The park
was as sleepy as the town. A few dog walkers here and there. A cyclist
with laden panniers eating lunch out of a can. An old man smoking a
cigarette in his car with the windows up and engine running. We had to
manufacture all of the excitement ourselves; boulder scrambling, fence
climbing, rock throwing, an aborted attempt at a swim by a toddler, some
yelling, more whining. Our stay was short, but I fear we may have
brought too much get-up-and-go for this park and it denizens. I set the
cruise control at 25 and we back-tracked through town and out to the
highway.</p>

<p>In addition to sending us to new and exciting corners of this state,
our Parks Challenge has consistently pushed us through times of low
motivation to be more active and engaged with the kids. It often means
naps in the car and eating more travel snacks than an ideal diet would
call for, but, in general our determination – our grit – has been richly
rewarded. That said, we may have pushed it a bit too far on our trip to
Scenic Beach.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_scenicbeach.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>As we loaded the ferry in downtown Seattle bound for Bremerton, Erin
felt a migraine coming on. It was, physically, too late to turn around
as such a maneuver on the dock en route to the boat would have likely
caused a visit from the Coast Guard. Ferry trips during COVID aren’t
nearly as much fun as its hard to keep the kids from running around on
the passenger decks. Fortunately, it was an early morning boat and the
exterior top level, the sun deck was empty. It was not sunny and was
somewhat cold, but it was large enough and well fenced that I could
singularly, and safely, corral them without endangering other
passengers. Armed with plentiful snacks, we survived the hour long
crossing. The three boys terrorizing the upper level of the boat; mom
resting in the car.</p>
<p>The forecast had called for 10% chance of rain. Upon our arrival the
rain began and continued for the entire drive to the park. As we
disembarked the automobile it tapered to a light drizzle. Erin had
improved to the point where should could take a small hike down to the
beach. The tide was up, obscuring most of the beach. The kids got into
some rotten apples that had fallen from a tree and nearly were attacked
by yellow jackets. The youngest had a bowel movement that his diaper
didn’t quite hold. Upon returning from that cleanup, I cut my hand
showing the elder child how to open an oyster with a rock. We abandoned
the beach for a hike in the woods. After the first small hill, and
noting the frustrating morning, no doubt, the elder child declared that
he didn’t want to be at a park any more and just wanted to go home. So
we did. Multiple hours in travel, 45 minutes at Scenic Beach Park. On
the plus side, both kids got to sit atop a decommissioned torpedo on the
Bremerton wharf while we waited for the return boat…clearly the
highlight of the trip.</p>

<p>Heading west from the Tri-Cities you leave the Columbia and begin to
climb back up the eastern flank of the Cascades along the Yakima River.
Decades of irrigation projects have turned this valley into a bright
green ribbon among the arid hills. As we rose in elevation the air began
to clear. Nowhere near normal, but to a level much more suitable for
outdoor exploration.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_yakimasportsman.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Yakima Sportsman, our eighth and final park of this overnight trip,
is located directly across the river from downtown Yakima. The approach
is not lacking in suburban appeal. Once inside, it is easy to forget you
are in the city. Or at least it felt that way on a very quiet, early
Saturday morning. COVID had closed the camping areas for the season and
the only other park patrons there at this hour consisted of a group busy
training search and rescue dogs.</p>
<p>We embarked on a short hike through the barren and ghostly
campground, up and over the abandoned rail line and on to the banks of
the Yakima River. At that very moment a small herd of deer were fording
the river, an act we knew happened but had never actually witnessed.
Despite it being late summer and one of little rain at all, the river,
fed by snow melt, is still high and swift. The deer managed the crossing
successfully, looking to have swam for a small bit at the deepest part.
After a quick breakfast in the parking lot, we were back in our trusty
steed aimed for Seattle some 150 minutes away with Ken Burns and his
take on Lewis &amp; Clark’s journey to keep us entertained.</p>

<p>The smoke had settled into the Walla Walla River basin thick and low,
allegedly to PM2.5 levels near the worst in the country and likely the
world. We left at day break, amidst low visibility, a choking smell and
empty roadways; an eerie, post-apocalyptic scene. On our way we passed
the (geologically) famous <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallula_Gap">Wallula Gap</a>, though
air quality would not allow for a remote view nor time an intimate
inspection. After crossing the Snake River once again, we exited the
freeway, bound for Sacajawea State Park.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_sacajawea.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>By this time in our road trip, our initial audio book had completed.
Inspired by stories about the European exploration of the West, we
quickly downloaded Ken Burns’ short history of Lewis &amp; Clark to fill
the remainder of our drive. Thus, our arrival at Sacajawea, located at
the confluence of the Snake and Columbia Rivers, was very apropos. As
our history teachers no doubt told us, and what this book would later
re-enforce is the centrality of Sacajawea – the trips only indigenous
member and only woman – the success of the Corps of Discovery’s journey.
Naming the park after her seems a deserved, if still too, small of an
honor.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as is often the case in our travels, we were too
early. The gates to the park would not open for another hour or so. I
sprinted (OK, lightly jogged) inside to capture a photo of the park’s
signage and to use the facilities. Itching to stretch my legs a bit
more, I continued on for a short bit down the Sacajawea Heritage Trail
to the water’s edge. Looking out over the Columbia – which, oddly
enough, flows east here until it turns south and then west at Wallula –
I could see no evidence of modern society. Though, to be fair, I could
not see very far. Geese honked, a dog parked and the river quietly
rolled on just as it has for millennium. Little did it know that what
Lewis &amp; Clark’s trip would ultimately engender would take from it
its freedom and most of its salmon.</p>

<p>After abandoning our campsite at Fields Spring on account of the
deteriorating air quality, we headed back west in the hopes of finding
indoor accommodation for the night. A brief pit stop for fuel, snacks
and some inquiring phone calls to hoteliers and we were off to Walla
Walla for the night. It would mean we were 90 minutes closer to home for
the drive tomorrow. It also meant 90 more minutes in the car today. We
were now racing downstream with the Snake River on our starboard side,
dry yellow hills and buttes on our port. The sun hung low in the sky, a
bright red orb so obscured by the smoke that you could look directly at
it without averting your gaze. As our distance to Walla Walla decreased,
so, too, did the visibility.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_lewis&clarktrail.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>We would need to make a brief stop. Lewis &amp; Clark Trail State
Park – our sixth of the day – was en route. Not surprising given that
Highway 12 from Lewiston to Waitsburg roughly follows their Eastbound
(return) Overland route. We pulled into the park amidst a choking haze.
We did a very slow circuit through the campground, pausing briefly as we
crossed over the trail. I remain skeptical as to the likelihood that the
modern day trail lies along their party’s exact footsteps, but it is a
piece of American History, nonetheless. Upon leaving, we stopped long
enough for a requisite Merriwether Lewis pose (one hand blocking the
sun, the other pointed off into the distance) in front of the park’s
signage. Then quickly back inside the car where, to be honest, the air
was probably no cleaner.</p>
<p>Back on the road as we, like the early explorers, inched ever closer
to the mighty Columbia. Leaving Lewis &amp; Clark’s route and crossing
deeper into Wine Country the change was subtle but evident even without
being able to see the vines blanketing the surrounding hills. The
buildings are in better repair, especially those calling to tourists.
The political signs fewer in number and shading much bluer. The global
economy – the one President Jefferson had hoped would flow through the
Northwest Passage – has greater reach here than it does just a few hours
east.</p>

<p>From Lyons Ferry we continued East along the Lewis &amp; Clark
Memorial Highway (US 12). Upon reaching Clarkston, WA – sister city to
Lewiston, ID across the Snake River – we turned due south up the very
crooked Highway 129. This is Asotin County, the farthest corner of the
state. Our destination, Fields Spring State Park is the most distant of
all the state parks, in straight line measurement, from our home in
Seattle at 265.4 miles. Via roadways it closer to 350. Judging by the
political signage, it still isn’t far enough from Seattle for the people
here. In fact, a number of ambitious souls were suggesting splitting the
state into two whereby west of the Cascades would remain Washington and
east of it would become Liberty, our 51st state.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_fieldsspring.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>After you rise out of the Snake River valley you crest out on the
high plateau and the Blue Mountains come into view. At first it is flat,
treeless farmland. Gradually the incline leads into sparse, then dense,
pine forests. According to <a href="https://www.airnow.gov">AirNow</a>
this far corner of Washington had the least dangerous air in the state;
nonetheless our mountain views were vastly diminished.</p>
<p>The entrance to the park is discrete and we nearly missed it.
Likewise, we couldn’t find the standard brown, wooden sign. We had
booked a campsite for here for the night. We paid it a visit, it seemed
well enough but with the uncertainty around air quality for the evening,
we had made the decision to retreat to a hotel for the evening. In place
of camping, we drove out to the far corner of the park and went for a
short walk in the hopes of catching some views of Hells Canyon and Idaho
and Oregon beyond. Despite the growing haze, we could easily see three
states from where we stood. Little did we know at the time, this would
be our last glimpse of blue skies and breathes of fresh air for some
time (going on five days at the time of this writing). Back into the car
and on the road again, this time reclaiming some of the distance to
home. I do regret not having more time to spend here. The miles of
hiking/snowshoeing trails, the limited camping spots and the mountain
views make Field Springs one of the few parks that we’ve visited so far
that caters to the more active crowd (no beaches, not much room for
RVs). We promised to stop again the next time a road trip takes us to
the far southeastern reaches of Washington State as it would make a
great base camp for exploring this entire region.</p>

<p>I noted (lamented?) the extreme isolation of Palouse Falls in
relation to anything else of possible interest or concern. I had,
knowingly, taken a bit of poetic license with the truth. If you continue
your journey just a seven miles down the road you will be rewarded with
a second State Park, Lyons Ferry. Though be forewarned that the former
is considerably more exciting.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_lyonsferry.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>The smoke had continued to pour in from the south giving Lyons Ferry
a low, artificial ceiling. We were one of a small handful of groups
enjoying the grounds here at the confluence of the Snake and Palouse
Rivers. A roving herd of wild turkeys roamed with authority while geese
and other unidentified fowl played out their natural machinations in the
calm backwaters of the river. A beach suggested that the swimming might
be good here, though we did not test the waters. Nor did we do much
hiking around. The interpretative signage, both of the Ice Age floods
and of the visit by the Corps of Discovery (Lewis &amp; Clark) some 200+
years ago were excellent and we left much wiser about the geological and
European history of the area. Consider this an educational stop. The
rail line that crosses far overhead seem impossibly narrow and liable to
blow over in the softest of breezes; a feat of early 20th century
engineering.</p>
<p>On this trip we were listening to an audio book, <a
href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/astoria-peter-stark?variant=32122181812258">Astoria</a>,
by Peter Stark. As we worked our way south east across the State toward
the Snake River, Astor’s 1810 overland party was struggling through
Hells Canyon along this same river, though a few hundred miles upstream.
We had food, water and a reliable and fast mode of transit. By this
point in their journey they had none of these, save some old moccasins
to chew on and the occasional meal of horse meat. Despite our
differences in circumstance, we felt some kinship with this ragged band
of fortune seekers. Their travails shaped our mood – one of
thankfulness, mostly, but also just a hint of envy regarding their short
list of concerns, tasks and responsibilities. Move, eat, sleep, stay
alive. Leaving Lyons Ferry we crossed over the Snake at 55 miles per
hour with the air conditioning on while enjoying a snack of fresh fruit
(our party shall not fall prey to scurvy)…perhaps modern travel wasn’t
so bad after all.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>To get to Palouse Falls, you drive to the absolute, literal, middle
of nowhere and then turn left down a dirt road for a few miles. Once you
cross over a rail line blasted through pure basalt and find yourself in
an odd labyrinth of parking lots you’ll know you are there. Past the
parking lots, a massive crack in the earth appears with a waterfall
plunging 200ft down into into a canyon. Pure vertical walls of the same
height again rise up on either side of the falls, giving the canyon a
much grander appearance.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_palousefalls.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Were it not for its location of utmost inconvenience, the park would
likely be overrun with tourist buses, a gift shop and acres of paved
parking. On this hot, smoky afternoon, there were but a few dozen people
milling about the grounds. A busier park would also need more fencing
and patrols for safety. The drop into the abyss is sudden and lethal. A
small fence surrounds the main viewing platform. As you venture out up
above the falls the only prophylactics here are a few signs reminding
you that previous hikers have died here so don’t be stupid.</p>
<p>We took the sinuous route out along the highest butte, then back down
along the railroad and finally down the steep grade to the river above
the falls. The Palouse River here is mostly small bubbling rapids as the
water tumbles forward, oblivious to the abrupt trip it will take in a
few hundred yards. Set against the towering rock walls carved by the
river itself, the hollow is striking. And, on a hot day, oppressively
warm. If the rocks were sandstone instead of basalt, vermilion instead
of jet black, it could easily be mistaken for Zion, Canyonlands or one
of the many other lesser known parks of Southern Utah.</p>
<p>The Falls are a treasure. An under-developed, under-advertised and
under-visited gem. And that’s OK. You really have to work to get to this
park and in that, too, there is some sense of accomplishment, or at the
very least a nod to your determination and grit. For, as you return to
your car and wipe the sweat from your brow you again realize where you
are which is, no matter where you are headed, a long way from your
destination.</p>

<p>East of Othello, life dwindles. Human, animal, plant. All of it. The
next recognizable town on the map is Washtucna. Dry and dusty, the
shuttered storefronts and deferred maintenance suggested that Washtucna
had seen better days. Past wealth from agriculture had moved on.
Additionally, the smoke had continued to roll in, giving the entire area
a post-apocalyptic feel.</p>

<p>We entered and promptly found the main office of the Columbia Plateau
Trail State Park. It was closed. We were not surprised by this finding.
One could scarcely imagine the boredom of the poor ranger who drew the
assignment to man this desk on a weekday. Had anyone been so
unfortunate, they likely flipped the small sign to ‘Closed’ and laid
down for a nap in the back room. Or, perhaps, they were at lunch. No
matter, we grabbed a photo as proof of our visit and were on our
way.</p>
<p>As we rolled on to our next park, we crossed over the trail. We
slowed and looked each direction. The path, long and straight. The
ground, rocky and dry. The air, hot and smoky. No shade in sight. Not a
day to be out on the Columbia Plateau Trail for any real length of time.
Post-trip research showed it to be a work in progress. Over 130 miles of
former railroad bed stretching from south of Spokane to the Tri-Cities.
The sections near the two ends were well developed, in the middle –
where we now stood – it remained a bit wilder.</p>

<p>A tractor attempting to turn left had blocked east bound traffic. We
waited patiently as we were, unfortunately, going that direction as
well. Normally, stopping the vehicle would wake the kids in the back
bringing an abrupt end to a peaceful drive. But today, this trip, it was
just us two. Adults, an open road and a number of far-flung parks to
check off of our list. The road cleared and we followed the farm
implement down one of the arrow-straight roads branching off from
Highway 26 in perfect perpendicular fashion every mile or so.
Destination: Potholes State Park.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_potholes.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Like so much of Washington east of the Columbia, the land here was
shaped by the glacial floods. Scablands, as they are often referred to.
In the 1930s and 1940s, the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project radically
changed the face of this land, adding dams, canals, reservoirs. From
this followed power generation and agriculture. The semi-arid land now
transformed into a critical piece of the state’s economy. The Potholes
Reservoir collects up-gradient irrigation runoff and then redistributes
it to down-gradient canals. A massive holding tank turned recreational
water body.</p>
<p>It wasn’t particularly busy on a hot Friday morning in September. A
few power boats raced back and forth across the water. An elderly man
happily cleaned a few fish at the designated station near the boat
launch. The irrigated grass beneath the willow trees on the main park
grounds was plush; shockingly green against the dusty hills that
surround it. The reservoir was low, well below the obvious shoreline. It
hadn’t rained here in months. An aroma of stale water and dying aquatic
plants filled the air. We walked out through the late summer mud and
mire to the water’s edge where a nearby group of children collectively
pulled a cement block attached to a rope across the cracked and drying
mud. Busy little trilobites skirting the sea floor.</p>
<p>The forecast called for smoke to blow north from the massive fires in
Oregon. Leaving the park, we could see the weather models were going to
be correct. We opted for the scenic route through the Columbia National
Wildlife Refuge on our way back to the highway. Here the native basalt
columns, sage brush and small, tepid ponds remained in their natural
format. A preferable state to the neighboring reservoir, in my
opinion.</p>

<p>Packed and out of the hotel, we were climbing back up Highway 2 with
the sun rising behind us at 7:15 am. Our haste precipitated mostly by a
deep desire to avoid being caught in Labor Day traffic headed back into
Seattle. Also, there is only so long you can keep two small children
alive in a 200 square foot hotel room full of sharp corners, uncovered
outlets and loosely hung wall mirrors. We had not yet caused any damage
to property or person. Best not to tempt the fates any longer than
absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>A sharp exit onto Dryden Road put us at the entrance to Peshastin
Pinnacles State Park. The entrance is a far as we would be going. The
park was closed for the summer due to utility work. The Pinnacles is
mostly a climber’s park, with a number of shear rock faces jutting
vertically from the surrounding hills. Orchards below, power lines
overhead, the two primary drivers of the local economy – fruit and
electricity – cannot be escaped, at least for now. As we learned from
the signage, the utility work being done will remove the power lines
returning the Pinnacles to their natural state.</p>
<p>You might be asking if such a quick stop is in the spirit of our
State Parks Challenge. The answer is, unequivocally, “Yes”. All we can
control is our intent. Well, that and our attitudes, though that can be
challenging at times. We had intended to visit and had set foot on park
property. Mark it down. Some parks will inevitably get more attention
than others, such is a whirlwind tour of a state this vast and varied.
In case that rationale doesn’t sit well with you, I scaled the entrance
gate just to demonstrate the extent of our intent. It is a climber’s
park, after all.</p>

<p>Late afternoon on a long, hot day split equally between hours in the
sun and hours in the car. The sane choice would have been blowing past
Lincoln Rock State Park in favor of the air-conditioned confines of our
hotel room. A dip in the pool. A cleansing shower. The chilled adult
beverages waiting in the fridge. But that would mean coming back to
Lincoln Rock in the morning or on another trip. Subservient to the
quest, we exited the highway and entered our fourth park of the day.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_lincolnrock.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Every boat owner in the greater Wenatchee area was here as well. The
park offers the closest boat launch above the Rocky Reach Dam and was
being used to its fullest on a hot Sunday afternoon. There was no
shortage of swimmers either as the beach was an absolute melee. A very
pre-COVID scene; comforting in its normality, but also too much for us
weary travelers to venture into.</p>
<p>The lone parking spot we could find was directly adjacent to the
park’s snack shop. Ice cream was advertised in big chalk letters. I
needed no further encouragement. Serving as the vanguard, the eldest
child and I were the first to order. In reading off the flavors, I made
a critical parenting mistake by mentioning that there was a bubble gum
option. Once that option was heard, there was no changing of his mind. I
knew he wouldn’t like it. No one likes bubble gum ice cream. Seriously,
<a
href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/worst-ice-cream-flavors_n_5547394">research</a>
shows it is the second worst ice cream flavor of all time, after only a
Viagra-laced variety. A minute later I’m holding my delicious mint ice
cream and his toxic blue abomination. After one spoon full he declared
it ‘awful’ and began poaching mine. I tried it out on the one-year old.
He turned up his nose at it as well. Five minutes later, I’m left
holding a melted cup of chemical blue sugar milk. The yellow jackets
wouldn’t even stop to drink from it. I made sure to carefully deposit it
in the trash lest any leak out onto the ground and kill the grass or
poison the groundwater.</p>

<p>Back across the high farmlands of the plateau and down into the
Columbia Valley. North this time from Orondo and up to Daroga State
Park. By some miracle the kids slept nearly the entire way, freeing the
adults from the unstoppable litany of ‘why’ questions and the
intermittent provision of snacks. Ninety minutes to ponder the wonders
of Douglas County, most of which was consumed strategizing on how best
to pass various slow moving trucks and RVs without waking the
children.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_daroga.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>It was mid-afternoon by the time we had parked and the heat was full
on, upper 90s. The high voltage lines that ran through the park crackled
and hissed as they powered air-conditioning units from Leavenworth to
Lynnwood and from Yakima to Yelm. The park was busy, but generally well
socially-distanced except for the five generational, 50 person strong
birthday party that occupied the eastern half of the beach. We circled
it widely, and found two thick and welcoming shade trees between which
to string the hammock and settle in for a calm afternoon out of the
earshot of speedboats and jetskis.</p>
<p>We had chosen this swimming spot outside of cordoned beach mainly to
provide some breathing room from the rabid packs of siblings and cousins
juiced up on frosting and Capri Sun. Unfortunately, after about ten
minutes in the water we realized it was proximate to a mystery water
pipe that discharged water at irregular intervals. No one else seemed
the least bit concerned about it, so we carried on in standard fashion,
though just a little more careful than normal to avoid any accidental
imbibing of the river water. Well, some of us. For the little one, we
aren’t quite past the ‘random objects in mouth’ phase so undoubtedly he
consumed some small amount of whatever was in the water. Let’s hope it
leads to some X-Men-like super power and not a third eye like that fish
on the Simpsons. It is hardly an adventure if there isn’t a bit of
risk.</p>

<p>From Sun Lakes-Dry Falls it was up the Grand Coulee to Steamboat
Rock. From whence the flood waters of the last ice age came, almost.
Here to, the camping area and manicured park grounds are a sharp green
against the brown hills; the river supplying all of the scenery in one
way or another. It was nearly 10am, 85 degrees and headed much higher.
The traffic at the boat launch a harbinger of the mass of humanity about
to congregate on the beach here.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_steamboatrock.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Loaded down with our beach necessities, we hiked a half mile or so
down the perfect sand beach to a shaded spot under a loan willow tree,
hundreds of yards from the few other groups scattered along the beach. I
ran back to the car to inflate the paddleboard and brought that to our
camp as well.</p>
<p>The water was the perfect temperature; cool enough to refresh but not
to shock. Boat traffic steadily grew, making the crossing over to the
rock islands on a paddleboard treacherous. These weren’t the languid
sailboats and slow moving crafts of the marine NW Washington variety.
No, here they were floating race cars ripping through the narrow channel
at 40 plus miles an hour. We each took a turn exploring, doing a bit of
Frogger on the way there and back. As we swam, the beach steadily filled
with large groups and their boats. By noon, we were surrounded on both
sides by dozens of parties. Spring Break 2020! Or something like it. Per
the usual, we were the black swan, the ugly duckling, the sore thumb,
the only people there without some form of motorized watercraft. In a
weak attempt at blending it, we loaded the paddleboard down like a fresh
mule for the trip back to the car to moved our cargo home the way river
folk intended.</p>
<p>The beach here is fantastic. Absolutely stunning in its beauty; the
fine sand, the clear water and the surrounding hills and cliffs are all
worth the trip on their own, let alone all together. Easily the best
fresh water beach we’ve been to in Washington. Unfortunately, it is a
little too nice as it gets overrun on sunny weekend. Seems like the
perfect place to camp midweek, maybe just after Labor Day. The hiking
looks stellar as well, not something that fit into our tight
schedule.</p>

<p>The drive from Wenatchee to Coulee City (home of Sun Lakes-Dry Falls
Park) is a journey of contrast. First across and along the wide, slow
rolling Columbia River full of orchards and power lines. Then up the
Corbaley Canyon with its Ponderosa Pines and steep slopes. And, finally,
out onto to the flat, dusty farmlands of the plateau. Confident you’ve
seen it all for the day, the Grand Coulee at Dry Falls offers another
landscape all together different and much more alien that the others. A
deep gash in the earth with tall basalt column walls and a variety of
small lakes hidden within.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_sunlakesdryfalls.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Down the long ramp into the abyss we went. Past the golf course and
swimming beach, we headed for the farthest reaches of the park up near
the once roaring, now still, Dry Falls. A winding, unpaved route, we
finally put our AWD Subaru to the test on some primitive roads. Believe
it or not, the first significant unpaved travel of our State Parks
Challenge to date. After a few small bumps and potholes we landed at a
small turn around next to an outhouse and a wetlands full of tall reedy
material. Signage was minimal (read: absent). We chose the path most
well-traveled – Robert Frost be damned – as it would be the most
pleasant for the tiny legs in the group. The trail eventually led to a
small rise on which we could overlook the remaining lake at the bottom
of the once mighty falls. Small effort, small reward in this case. The
most popular part of the trip for all involved was tracking the large
rabbit and small bird that had made tracks alongside our trail.</p>
<p>The inside of the Coulee is a village of its own – a golf course,
campgrounds, swimming holes, Duke’s Diner – and truly has something for
everyone. There is also a lot here at Sun Lakes-Dry Falls for the
interested and able hiker. With our small kids and the hot weather we
only met the first of those requirements and had to leave the more
intrepid parts of the park for a future trip, probably in Spring or Fall
when the weather on the West Side is damp and gray and one can fully
appreciate being cooked inside this natural cauldron.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Wenatchee Confluence Park was so close to our hotel (straight line
distance: 1,300 feet to be exact). In fact, we could see it from the
parking lot. We considered walking but railroad tracks, lack of
sidewalks, no direct route and the heat forced us to think better of
that option. Back in the car for a very short drive to our third park of
the day.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_wenatcheeconfluence.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Lush is the appropriate word. And a welcome site after an afternoon
of driving through sun-dried hills, rock walls and dust. Contrasted with
the surrounding golden ridges of the plateau to the east and the blue
waters of the Columbia, the irrigated greens of Wenatchee Confluence are
a striking site. The thermometer in the car read 100. We grabbed the
bare minimum of accessories – mostly water – and made quick time across
the soft grass to the swimming area.</p>
<p>We feared a crowded beach, as Lake Wenatchee had been. To our utmost
surprise the crowd was reasonable. Surprising given the heat, or perhaps
because of it. The generators in the camping areas hummed, keeping the
RVs cool. Powerboats raced up and down the river. Clearly, the locals
and the professional campers weren’t about to go out in this weather,
and if they did, it was going to be out on the water. All to our gain.
We were able to enjoy a pleasant evening at the beach on the Pacific
Northwest’s mightiest river. Inspired by our surrounds, on the walk back
to the car we read aloud the <a
href="https://www.woodyguthrie.org/Lyrics/Roll_On_Columbia.htm">lyrics</a>
to Woody Guthrie’s classic ‘Roll on Columbia’. I do not believe we did
the song justice as the kids quickly asked for more Raffi instead.

<p>This Labor Day weekend trip was of the last minute variety. We had,
as a result, under planned. Though we had a rough ordering of parks to
visit, we were leaving the specifics of what to do at each up to chance.
Relying on spontaneity to carry us through. To the poet,
serendipity.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_squilchuck.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Pulling into Squilchuck, you could easily mistake the parking lot for
an old, though admittedly short, tarmac. We stepped out onto it and into
a still and sizzling 91 degrees. Looking around, we discovered this was
a mountain biking park complete with ramps, rails and all manner of
exciting things to do on a bicycle. A few small groups occupied the
prime shaded spots. What remained was a lone picnic table baking in the
sun next to a dusty set of jumps. A fine lunch spot, indeed.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, our kids are big fans of a certain <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_7k3fnxPq0">video</a> featuring
Danny MacAskill – a RedBull sponsored mountain biker – doing insane
things on a bike all through Scotland. We channeled our inner Danny and
manufactured some fun by giving the course all we could on our two feet
instead of two wheels. The children became intensely dirty as only kids
can and I nearly broke my ankle trying to land a 540 parkour twist, but
we made it out alive…and had a good, though sweaty, time doing so.
Serendipity had arisen to meet the call.</p>

<p>What a difference the pass makes. From Seattle to the windward slope
of Stevens Pass it was cloudy, calm and cool. Speeding by the
chairlifts, the sky immediately broke open, the temperature jumped and
the wind howled. And, by some miracle, the youngest child slept the
entire way.</p>

<p>At Lake Wenatchee a ranger guided us to one of the last remaining
nearby parking spots. Just after 10am, it was a late arrival for us. We
are not accustomed to jockeying for parking, dealing with crowds or
waiting in general. A steady stream of cars followed. Saturday of Labor
Day weekend and the beach at Lake Wenatchee was going to be full. As we
settled in to a cozy spot up against a log, it was easily the most
crowded place we had been since COVID hit. Everyone was social
distancing fairly well, but still an odd feeling of ‘nearness’ to
strangers after so many months spent avoiding them. I wonder how long it
will take for us to shed these new-found habits? The deliberate side
step, the turning of the head, the instinct to isolate.</p>
<p>The wind blew hard right at the main beach. A number of kites were
launched; immediately claimed by the nearby trees. Unmanned inter tubes
returned quickly to shore. Aspiring paddleboarders thought better of the
chop and settled for a swim. I spent about a minute preparing a
flotation device for the eldest child. He lasted all of 30 seconds in it
before calling it quits. That 2:1 ratio of time preparing to time
actually used is universal. I’d argue its the Second Law of Parenting.
The First being, of course, that any slight discrepancy in discipline or
instruction provided separately by two parents will be exploited by the
child to their maximal advantage.</p>
<p>As the crowd grew we made an escape for a hike down the lake’s outlet
– the Wenatchee River. Pure serenity. No crowds or wind. We hung the
hammock and clambered around on some glacial erratics strewn throughout
the forest. There are some nice beach spots down along the river, though
the north side looks to be even better; more sun, more sand. Next time
we’ll skip the main beach and head here instead.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The southern approach to Larrabee State Park is via Chuckanut Drive
(Highway 11). After leaving I-5 it is a straight shot through the
lowland agricultural flats (correction: the upscale Bow-Edison
farm-to-market district) then climbing to skirt, sinuously so, along the
steep western slope of Chuckanut Mountain. This section is a highway –
speeding cars, stripped yellow line, high volume – but on nice days it
also doubles as a parking lot for the numerous hiking trails that begin
at the road. It is a sketchy affair to say the least. At 8am on a
Saturday morning, the standard parking pullouts were already full of
what looked to be mostly fit 20-somethings from Bellingham. And their
dogs. With night life limited and other healthy pursuits like yoga
shuttered as well, it is no surprise to see traffic on the trails
rise.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_larrabee.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>A decade ago we would have been parked and half way up the mountain
by now. Today, we sped past those pullouts and trail heads, cognizant of
our own jealousy but also joyously reminiscent of those days. Hiking
will return for us; just a few more years until all eight of our legs
are strong enough to pound out some wilderness miles. Lost in reverie, I
nearly made a wrong turn, but we did finally land at the main parking
lot to the Larrabee park beach. We were the first of our kind there. Our
kind being the now-childed former hikers still intent on spending our
free time outdoors.</p>
<p>Commissioned in 1913, Larrabee was Washington’s first State Park. It
maintains the feel of a place designed and built before the age of long,
wide vehicles. At a time when camping was a human and a tent, not a
30-foot RV. There is comfort in the intimacy of the roads and the spaces
here. There is also the occasional blast from the railroad that runs
directly through the middle of the lower, marine facing portion of the
park. This, too, a signal of the times that bequeathed this park.</p>
<p>A gentle breeze off the water made 58 feel chilly; for August. In
short, it was a nice fall morning, unfortunately six weeks too early. A
low tide left countless tide pools on the weathered sandstone
outcroppings. Each one full of small crabs, various mollusks and the
occasional stranded minnow. We were lucky enough to be visited by a
juvenile otter as well. He/she kept their distance, but played close
enough to give the kids a good show. By the drive back home the parking
melee along the road had intensified. I couldn’t help but chuckle,
knowing full well that for many of these eager, strong-thighed and free
young people they would be soon enough trading their minimalist
backpacks, trail runners and hydro-flasks for plastic shovels,
over-sized bags of snacks and sand. A lot of sand. Everywhere. In hair,
mouths, noses. In purses and wallets and food containers. Truly
everywhere.</p>

<p>Researching possible routes from which to approach Skagit Island, the
large peninsula that nearly reaches out and nearly touches it is rarely,
if ever, mentioned. It’s a strange omission; looking at a map, a clear
defiance of common sense, prudence, ease. Perhaps it is the relative
recency with which the Kukateli peninsula returned to public land
status. More likely, we determined, it is a concerted effort to keep
this, somewhat obscure, preserve a secret. With our limited readership,
I don’t feel I’m betraying local adventurers, bird watchers and
beach-bums by mentioning it here. Back at the map, the major impediments
to our proposed plan appeared to be limited parking and the need to
carry your gear – and in our case our children and their gear – about a
mile to the beach near the western end of the peninsula. Early risers
with plenty of portable and/or wheeled goods, we took this bet.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_skagitisland.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>And, I’m happy to report that it paid off splendidly. At 8am only two
of the seven parking spots were filled. We hiked down a hill, over the
tombolo (formerly a road, now returned to its natural state), up and
over another, larger hill, down past the former homestead and onto the
narrow beach facing Skagit Island. I had the inflated paddleboard on my
back while pushing the pram, filled mostly with food as the youngest
child had escaped. Erin, with our beach setup in a large back pack,
ended up carrying the youngest whose independent streak lasted up until
the hill climb. The elder child marched along backpack laden with fig
bars, rocks from previous beaches and a change of shoes, keeping a
steady pace of two or three ‘why?’ questions per minute. A merry caravan
were we.</p>
<p>From our temporary post on the deserted beach it was a .25 mile
paddle over to Skagit Island. With a few kayakers heading in and out
during the morning, the small landing area on Skagit Island was busier
than the beach on the mainland. A quaint little island, it has a few
campsites, a pit toilet and a small beach on its eastern shore.
Certainly there are more adventurous or beautiful island sin the State’s
Marine Park System, but for a short 1 mile hike and a half-mile,
round-trip paddle, few are as accessible without a power boat. In
addition, the Kukateli Preserve itself is worthy of the trip. If you
want a parking spot or first crack at the blackberries or apple trees,
make sure you get there early…and don’t tell too many others as we’d
like to return to an empty lot and a quiet beach in the future.</p>

<p>To date, our assault on Marine State Parks have been either via
friends’ boats or on childless adventure days. Today we tried a
different approach: divide and conquer. One of us at a time paddling our
way to an island and back. The other minding the kids – frantically
keeping one from eating rocks and the other from running off into the
riptide (cue Vance Joy).</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_hopeislandskagit.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Departing from Ala Spit county park Hope Island (the Skagit version)
offered itself as an easy target via paddleboard. From our aerial image
reconnaissance, the spit, too, appeared worthy of a visit so we opted to
make a day of it. To beat the heat and to align with the low, slack tide
for our crossings we arrived early. What we hadn’t factored in was that
it was also a weekend with a very low tide during clamming season. As a
result, the beach was busy with large groups wearing knee-high boots,
stomping through the tidelands and carrying all manner of oddly-shaped
shovels. Enter us with our bare feet, swimsuits and paddleboard; four of
these things were not like the others. Like the metal-detector guy who,
so focused on his craft, wanders through an outdoor wedding, we cut
through their mix and headed for the water. Oddballs, no matter.</p>
<p>Despite the slack tide the 0.4 mile crossing to Hope Island wasn’t
easy. Dodging powerboats and fighting the rip, it is a battle to
maintain anything resembling a straight path. The tidal current is a
river, and a fairly fast one at that, about 100 yards wide right in the
middle of the channel. It is smooth sailing on either side, but you have
to paddle your heart out to get across it and at the same time try to
keep from catching an errant wake. We went at the best of all times –
early morning, low, slack tide – and it was still a struggle. Neither of
us spent much time on the island itself. Just long enough to catch our
breath, take a few photos and lament the lost opportunity to spend the
entire afternoon on a mostly deserted island. We are happy to report,
however, that the spit itself was a wonderful place for small children
to play and even with dozens of groups out foraging it still had plenty
of room to social distance as well as very cool driftwood forts to play
among. Bear in mind Ala Spit is a mostly rocky beach and there are no
toilets, no water, no shade.</p>

closer to five by road. We upped that into eight or so by missing our

<p>The beach at Penrose was considerably busier than Joemma. It is
flatter, sandier and, overall, more easily accessible. Most definitely
better set up for all generations to access the water. We walked the
exposed shore out along the western side of the eponymous ‘point’ of the
park. It is a dramatic edge. Steep cliffs with trees clinging off at 90
degree angles. Occasionally undercuts, caves almost, caused by the wave
action. The low tide made this traverse possible; a high tide would have
been a wet walk.</p>
<p>Rounding the point in this manner greets the intrepid with an amazing
view of Mt. Rainier. Its about fifty miles from here, but seems much
closer as it looms over the sky to the ESE. The water is clearer,
crisper on the east side of the point. A welcome contrast to the muddy
bay from whence we came. Like nearly all parks at any level of
jurisdiction, the size of the crowds declines exponentially as the
distance from the parking lot increases. We had the point to ourselves
on this calm, bluebird August day in the PNW…all for the price of mile
walk.</p>

<p>Crossing the Purdy Sand Spit and entering the town of Wauna a signs
urges you to ‘Discover Key Peninsula’. We had. Like Harstine Island, the
Key Peninsula was unknown to me prior to planning this trip. The steady
vehicle traffic, many laden with campers, kayaks and kids, would suggest
we were late to the party, figuratively speaking.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_joemmabeach.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>It was a weekday, after all, and the Joemma Beach parking lot was
scarcely 25% full at 11am, though the boat launch was quite active.
Joemma is a nice, little crescent-shaped bay, southwest facing and with
an impressive dock that sports room for a dozen or so boats. You could
certainly do worse in choosing a place for a snack and a nap.</p>
<p>We spent a bit of time scouring the beach for treasures for the kids.
The oldest child is collecting both beach glass and agates and we
support this mission on our adventure days – its the least we can do for
leaving him behind while we are out exploring. Beach glass is a fairly
common on any beach near civilization, it’s like finding a stick in the
woods. Agates, however, are a true prize. Ignorant of the proper
technique for finding the elusive agate (see <a
href="http://wwww.pnwbeachcombing.com">www.pnwbeachcombing.com</a> for
helpful hints), I relied on the tried and true method of letting my gut
decide. Doing so conjures the gambler’s tickle. That atavistic feeling
that you might just know something others don’t. That the roulette ball
will hit your number this time. That your horse will pull off an upset.
That the next pan will hold the gold nugget. That your lottery numbers
will come up. Rationally, you know better, but that pang of superstition
can be hard to suppress. It can be a bit liberating, too, to let the
subjective and the spontaneous crowd into our, often, objective and
planned lives if only for a respite. Am I waxing too poetic about rocks?
Yes, most certainly. This aside, our agate collection grew by two.</p>

<p><img src="waparks_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-41-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Early on a Friday morning we found ourselves back on the shores of
Kopachuck Beach. Things were different this time, though. The tide was
out, the crowds were gone, the wind was down, the boat traffic
non-existent and, most importantly, we were childless. Intent on making
the crossing to Cutts Island we also had our paddleboards.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_cuttsisland.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>A bit winded from pumping up the boards – the rechargeable air pump
was not up to the task – we set off for the 0.8 mile crossing. Twenty
minutes later we beached on the eastern shore of Cutts. Though careful
to maintain much more than the recommended distance, our presence
spooked the basking seals and they made for a circuitous trip around us.
We felt their eyes, possibly sizing us up for a sneak attack. Or at the
very least pulling our boards back into the water just to see some
humans scramble and flail as they attempted to locomote their
land-lubbing bodies through the cold water of the Sound. Happy to report
our fears were unfounded.</p>
<p>After a quick trip around the island and out to the exposed tombolo
(formerly of the seal’s domain) we climbed up to the elevated plateau at
the center of Cutts Island. Hoping for a pristine-ish natural environs
like that which greets visitors on McMicken, we found reality a let
down. English Ivy (hedera helix) had taken over most of the ground and
the lower portion of the trees. In more exposed areas there was poison
oak (toxicodendron diversilobum). Discarded toilet paper and empty
alcohol containers filled in other hollows. Judging by the quality of
drink, I’d venture Cutts is a not-so-secret rendezvous point for high
schoolers (homo adolescenza) out on their parents’ boats. The cliff
face, the tombolo, the hanging madronas (arbutus menziesii), Cutts is
endowed with amble natural wonders; proximity to civilization and lack
of maintenance do leave the state of the park underwhelming. A day or
two of a work crew could have it in tip-top shape…and, yes, we would
gladly volunteer for this mission.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Formed by tidal diffraction and refraction, a tombolo is a narrow
strip of land connecting an island to a mainland. During high tide,
McMicken Island is, indeed, an island. During low tide its tombolo
surfaces tying it to the larger Harstine Island. We had our inflatable
paddleboards in the car, but opted for a land approach as we had timed
the tides correct, we hoped, and didn’t want to miss the chance to
experience this rare geographic formation.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_mcmickenisland.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Getting to the tombolo on foot isn’t an easy affair. After parking at
the lot in the old Harstine State Park (now just a satellite property of
Jarrell Cove State Park), a winding 0.3 mile path takes you down to the
beach. Then it is a slow and occasionally treacherous mile-long
tidelands hike across seaweed covered rocks, dozens of downed trees and
a number of small streams. We arrived at the foot of the tombolo just
shy of noon, tide at about +3.5 feet and dropping. The tombolo was fully
submerged, but we could see the sinuous line it cut as a disturbance in
the retreating tide. Shoes off, pants hike up we found that the deepest
crossing (2 feet or so) was in the immediate 50 feet. After that it
leveled out and then slowly shallowed. In crossing when we did, we had a
narrow but easy to follow path out to McMicken Island. The tide pulled
water hard across our feet; it was very similar to cross a shallow but
fast moving mountain stream. Crabs waited patiently in the lee of the
little ridge that had formed for lunch to float by. On either side of
the 6-foot wide path, it dropped off steadily to the surrounding shoal.
By the time we reached the McMicken Island side the very end of the
tombolo was beginning to breach the surface.</p>
<p>We had crossed from one island to another via a secret, underwater
path: We were legends. We surveyed the island of our conquest – a 1/2
loop hike makes this a quick affair – and settled in for lunch (and some
wine) on the beach. Hungry legends, it turned out. There is a small home
and various outbuildings on the SE corner sequestered behind a private
property sign. Strangely, a number of groups were camped on its grounds
(A later check of the county’s land records showed no private land on
the island, oddly enough). An hour after we had crossed, the entire
tombolo was exposed and the path back to Harstine Island was, quite
literally, a standard walk in the park. Our original, aquatic crossing
was much preferable to the return trip. I’d highly recommend timing the
tides right – at about 3.5 feet and falling – if you plan to access
McMicken Island by foot.</p>

<p>The area south of Bremerton, north of Olympia, west of Tacoma and
east of the Olympics – the Southwest Puget Sound – was definitely Terra
Incognita for me prior to planning today’s park visits. All I knew was
that it held many long narrow inlets, peninsulas, islands, trees and few
people. Asked to located Harstine Island on a map, I’m not certainly
where exactly I would have incorrectly pointed. Part of the beauty of
our park quest is in filling in those blank spots on my mental map of
our state.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_jarrellcove.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Dropping off of Highway 3, we avoided the siren call of the Olympic
Bakery and the Spencer Lake Bar &amp; Grill (largest pull-tab selection
in the state) and forged on through the Pickering District and up and
over the Harstine Bridge to the Island. A meandering road north takes
you to Jarrell Cove. Underwhelming on entry, once you get to the water
this park really shines. The sun had poked through by now and the water
was a deep blue-green, still as glass except for the refracted wake of
passing boats from the larger Case Inlet.</p>
<p>Both park docks were busy. One with boaters trading stories, the
other with a docking sailboat. Together with the neighboring marina, the
cove was at capacity with limited moorage available in any direction.
While Harstine Island was a mystery to me, it is clearly a known
quantity to the larger boating community…and for good reason. We gave
the shoreline and campground a ‘once-over’ hike to survey future
campsites and beach play areas and were on our way.</p>

<p>An overcast weekday morning, we were among the small handful of
visitors. But wandering the well-kept grounds you could almost feel the
generations of summer vacations that were had here. The sweaty tennis
matches, the trees climbed and the shells collected. Campfires, cookouts
and hide-and-go seek. Perhaps all the nostalgia was due to its
similarity to parks we visited during my youth in Northern Wisconsin, or
maybe it was just the joy of our adult-only day of adventure. Regardless
of the cause, the surrounds filled me with an invigorating spirit; my
steps light, my mood grand.</p>
<p>We didn’t stay long – we had upcoming adventures planned and a tight
timeline – but long enough to know we’d like to return in the future.
The dock looked relatively recently updated, perhaps arriving by water
would be a nice approach some day. I think the kids would have a field
day here.</p>

<p>Covid had nixed our plans for a 5-day group trip to Seabrook. We gave
most of the vacation days back, but kept Friday open for an adults-only
adventure. A mental health day. A relaxing time rushing from one state
park to another in the South West Puget Sound.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_belfair.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Kids to day care downtown, a short hop to the Bremerton Ferry, across
the Sound and then onward to Belfair State Park. Always on the lookout
for good future camping spots, we rolled through the campground upon
arrival. The beach loop, while located true to its name, had the look of
a used RV sale taking place on a poorly maintained cricket pitch. Hard
pass, we are tenting people. The tree loop offers some nicely tucked in
sites, though the highway is never far away.<br />
After creeping on the campers, we took a quick tour of the beach. Mud
flats, really. Tidal wetlands would be the correct term. An interesting
array of non-natural detritus littered the small cove we explored: a
mint-condition baseball hat, a well-used infant’s onesie and some legos.
Prohibitive signage in abundance as well. All manner of postings on the
beach and in the toilets directing park users when and when not to
forage for shellfish, what to and what not to eat of collected
shellfish, where and where not to clean shellfish and other game, and
how and how not to repair the tidelands after foraging. It is apparent
that previous users of Belfair State Park have struggled to self-educate
on proper shellfish harvesting actions prior to arrival.It is not a park
we are likely to return to, but I will say that, outside of Lake
Sammamish Park, these were the cleanest bathrooms at a state park we’ve
seen…possibly because of the helpful signage reminding users not to
clean fish in the toilets.</p>

<p>We are morning people. Most of our part visits occur early in the day
and, as such, we are generally one of few cars in the lot. Beaches and
trails to ourselves. Rolling into Kopachuck at 11:30 on a hot Sunday was
out of character for us and left us with crowds to navigate.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_kopachuck.jpg" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>A number of interweaving trails lead down to the beach; all were full
of people headed one way or the other. Half way down, the eldest had an
emergency need to go back up to the bathroom, so again we split.
Meandering through groups – half masked, half not – on the rocky beach,
I tucked us into a small little nest out the sun and the wind. Much of
the action at the park was paddle boarders and kayakers launching for
the crossing to Cutts Island State Park. Its not that far of a trip but
a someone treacherous one on the weekend with all the powerboats
criss-crossing the water.</p>
<p>Lunch, a brief swim and back to the car in time for naps on the ride
home. We managed three parks today, but a bit at the expense of our
sanity. The kids are good riders in the car, adventurous outdoorsmen and
overall supportive of our parks quest, however, sometimes too many
stops, too many ins and outs of the car wear us all out.</p>

<p>By water, Manchester State Park is just a few miles from Illahee. By
land is a longer journey. Down through Bremerton, past the Naval Yards –
an aircraft carrier was in, very cool – through the used car lots of
Gorst, back up through Port Orchard, along Beach Drive to the peninsula,
then back down again to the park. Long enough for one child to fall
asleep, the other to get hangry and us to make one wrong turn and then
an errant stop at Port Orchard Ford for picnic vittles (the navigator
thought Google Maps was showing her Port Orchard Food).</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_manchester.jpg" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>We arrived, bereft of food but still full of spirit. The receding
tide had left the main beach coated with drying and dying aquatic
plants. In addition to that stale marine smell, it also meant
treacherous footing. Soon, the elder child was splayed out on his back
in the muck. While tending to him, the younger one attempted to eat the
loose seaweed as well as some rocks. Our mood began to wane.</p>
<p>Zone coverage on the two children wasn’t working well, so we split up
for a man-to-man defense, rendezvousing later at the old Torpedo
Building. The de-activated naval mines out-front are a vivid reminder of
the military preparations done in and around the Puget Sound during the
first half of the 20th century. The overturned picnic tables and social
distancing signs within a reminder of our current battle just as
vivid.</p>

<p>We had planned a long weekend camping on the eastern side of the
Olympics. A series of blunders together with inattentive camp hosts and
greatly increased demand for time in the great outdoors during Covid
turned our imagined three-night getaway into 24 hours of frustration
wrapped around a night spend squatting in someone else’s camp site. In
the course of our wanderings we did manage to cross seven counties,
seventeen fire district and one national park boundary. Unfortunately,
with small children the journey is usually not the reward.</p>

towards travel with small kids, we summoned some vigor, and a bit of
vim, and decided to salvage the weekend. Sunday morning we caught an
early ferry to Bremerton and onward to some state parks.</p>
<p>By 9am it was evident it was going to be a great day for the beach.
Blue sky, slight breeze, heat. Illahee State Park has a number of
defining features – the world’s oldest Pacific Yew tree, a large,
stately dock for the boating class and cannons. The beach here, however,
is under-whelming. Even the beach glass was sub-par; mostly the thin
brown variety of recent vintage with little-to-no wear. Our discerning
three-year old wouldn’t waste the time to even pick it up. The Yew Tree
had been towered over by Douglas Firs and encroached upon by a
maintenance shed. From all appearances it was clearly yearning for more
independence. You could tell it was alive if you looked close enough,
but absent the signage one couldn’t be blamed for thinking it a common
snag. The cannons, at least the kids loved the cannons.</p>

<p>The Pacific Northwest is anything but tropical. Even during our 10
weeks of summer, the native botany, rocky beaches and mountain backdrops
will not let you forget where you are. But put yourself onto the white
sand beach of the western side of Clark Island on a warm, sunny day and
you just might, if you try hard enough, drum up visions of the
Mediterranean or maybe Central America. Until you touch the water. It is
still really cold.</p>

<p>Clark is a small stick of an island NE of Orcas. Its a 1 minute hike
from one side to the other east-west; the west side sandier than the
east. Great madrona groves cover the small rise between the two coasts
given the scene an appearance of out of this region. It is a glorious
little place, probably the best beach we’ve seen in the San Juan’s and
maybe all of Washington. Its not a secret to the boat/kayak crowd
either. There were half a dozen boats, a few full campsites and a
kayaker on a lazy Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>We don’t currently own a boat. This week’s island trips have been
courtesy of our friends and housemates for the week who recently
purchased one. Clark Island is the reason why we may soon be in the
market for a boat. With long-distance travel in limbo due to COVID we’re
slowly but surely awakening to the wonders our state has to offer. So
many of them are marine-based that it seems a shame to not be able to
easily reach them.</p>

<p>Our journey from hiking on Stuart Island to dinner on San Juan Island
took us past Posey Island. Less than a mile from glitzy Roche Harbor –
you can see the glean from the multi-million dollar yachts from its
shores – Posey is a postage stamp sized little rock with a few picnic
tables and a pit toilet.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_poseyisland.jpg" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>We convinced the captain to pull in as close as he felt comfortable –
its surrounded by reefs and rocks – and both of us piled onto a single
paddleboard for the short trip over. It was dead calm, the only movement
from disturbances caused by passing pleasure craft. Its a good thing
too, as it isn’t easy to paddleboard from the front of the board with a
moving human on the back. Then again, the water was never more than 3-4
feet deep so the worst that could have happened was an uncomfortable
dinner and a good story.</p>
<p>Our stay on the island was measurable in seconds. Our friends both
were keeping the boat off the rocks and watching our two kids. The least
we could do was hustle along. A (natural) toilet break and a few photos
later and we were off. Back onto the paddleboard designed for one and up
into the boat. Off to Roche, the Monaco of the San Juan’s. A former lime
kiln mill turned playground for the rich and others fortunate enough to
be on a watercraft, powered or otherwise.</p>

<p>Stuart Island is the westernmost of the San Juan Islands. Beyond it
lies the Haro Strait and then the Canadian Gulf Islands. Our trip here
from Orcas took us up around Waldron and Skipjack, very close the border
itself. In normal times, a radio to the Canadian Coast Guard would allow
passage to the nearest port of entry. But not now. That border – an
imaginary line in the water – is the edge of where we Americans can
travel. I hadn’t thought much about that fact until this very moment;
that for the first time in my life I wasn’t mostly free to travel
outside of our country. There, right in front of me was Saturna Island,
not three miles away and access was forbidden.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_stuartisland.jpg" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>From the near rendezvous with the border, we vectored SW and into
Prevost Harbor on Stuart’s North Side. Much of Stuart Island is private
land. A secluded little community out here at the edge of the country,
literally. I suspect that, like much of the San Juans, the population
hasn’t grown much over the years, with vacation homes taking from the
housing stock and astronomical building costs and limited economic
opportunities failing to replace the lost residents. A common fate in
amenity rich, economically challenged regions.</p>
<p>From the dock, we hiked up and over a ridge, along a cliff and down
to a sand/rock beach. While the older kids took turns whipping each
other with bull kelp, our youngest tried to swallow a rock. A child peed
shamelessly on the beach. Yelling, screaming and splashing scared a
perched osprey from its roost. A kayak tour approaching the beach landed
in the farthest possible location from us; perhaps in the name of social
distancing, perhaps self preservation. A childless person may well have
looked on our beach gathering with horror; as parents we saw no blood,
no tears, all was well. As the snacks ran out and our own hunger built,
we trekked back to the boat, through Johns Pass and onward towards
Spieden Island.</p>

<p>We awoke to a northerly breeze, moderate but consistent. To avoid the
chill and the chop, we headed inland to Moran State Park for the morning
session – our days bifurcated by the midday nap routine (requirement).
Moran was the state’s first major park and one of the largest at over
5,000 acres. Mostly a hiker’s paradise, there are a handful of gorgeous
mountain lakes spread throughout. Hiking has a different meaning with
toddlers and all involved had been to the peak of Mt. Constitution
before so we settled for some beach time at Cascade Lake.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_moran.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>An early arrival provided us with full control of the beach at the
roped off swimming area. Slowly the park came to life. First the geese,
then the shop workers, a few fishermen and then, eventually, other
families to the beach. Our end of the beach was the normal rodeo of
fights over splashing and toys, requests for snacks, sunscreen in the
eyes and brief moments of joy. Parents tagged in and out, usually
between hyper vigilance around the water and mindlessly checking our
phones.</p>
<p>Erin and I managed to slip in nice paddleboard trips across the lake
to the wooden bridge and the small lagoon beyond. The cross wind proved
formidable, but neither of us dumped in the water. Hopefully that was
enough exercise to justify ice cream and whisky later in the day.</p>

<p>Sucia Island is known as the crown jewel of the Washington State’s
Marine Park system. Its long fingers give it many miles of shoreline –
most of them steep cliffs or sand beaches – as well as multiple bays and
coves perfect for boat parking.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_suciaisland.jpg" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>We arrived, slalomed through the dozens of boats moored in the bay
and claimed the last remaining spot on the northernmost of the two
public docks in Fossil Bay. The kids wanted beach time immediately, we
adults made them earn it with a hike first. On the map the trail to Ev
Henry Point and back looks like a simple two mile loop. In reality, its
a fairly exposed hike and somewhat dangerous, at least for kids. There
are some severe drops just feet off of the trail, though with them,
views to match. I definitely recommend the hike; leave the children
behind.</p>
<p>The beaches are ideal. Very shallow slope with all manner of shells,
sticks and sea life. It was busy by remote island standards; practically
vacant from the perspective of city dwellers. Other than mask wearing on
the docks, you could almost forget about COVID out here. In fact, I
think that is what most visitors were trying to do. To bring back some
sense of normalcy to their lives with the grandest summer tradition of
them all: the beach day.</p>

<p>With an early start from Seattle we made the 7:40am ferry to Orcas
with time to spare. A last minute invite to split a house with some
friends has us headed to a different island than usual. San Juan County
has loosened their travel restrictions and the islands have begun to see
more actions – still off from a normal summer, but trending upwards.
After our last camping trip, we realized that with two car seats and all
the gear that comes with young kids our car travel situation was
lacking. We upgraded with a roof box, a new cooler and a large duffel
bag. Time to break in the new equipment. Yes, like every other
Seattlite, we now have a black Subaru Outback with a matching Thule roof
rack. Some things are just not worth being original about.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_obstructionpass.jpg" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>In additional to being a delightful place to spend a few summer days,
Orcas Island is also a great jumping off point for many of the State’s
Marine Parks. But first a stop at Obstruction Pass park on the main
island.</p>
<p>Arriving straight from the ferry landing, we unloaded and packed up
for a short hike the beach. The littler one is walking now and took off
sprinting for a nearby dog and end up face first in the mud and gravel
not 60 seconds after our arrival. Every good vacation starts with some
blood on your face. The undulating hike takes you less than a mile to
get to a secluded beach looking out to Obstruction, Blakely, Lopez and
Shaw Islands. The beaches here in the San Juan vary so in constitution.
Some have large rocks, other small, even sand in some places.
Obstruction Pass is somewhere right in the middle, the perfect size to
making walking optimally difficult. Combined with a slight incline, it
is a labor to walk 50 feet on this beach. So we didn’t. We sat, snacked
and splashed, watching the chipmunks while being watched by a hungry
raccoon. Then back to the car an onward to the house.</p>

<p>Our Friday night picnic plans for Blake Island had been derailed by a
forecast of strong northerly winds. The gale never really materialized,
but better safe than sorry when taking small children asea. We
rescheduled for the next morning which promised calmer waters.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_blake.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>With our friend’s new 28-foot pleasure craft as our trusty steed and
an experienced-ish seaman at the helm, the trip over was pleasant. Calm
but rainy. The standard cargo ships and ferries to dodge, but few other
pleasure crafts about. Ensconced in the cabin, the weather presented no
diminishment to the children’s joy of racing across the Puget Sound at
35 knots. Or my own, for that matter. The city and surrounds take on a
different look from the water. More grand in some sense, but also more
vulnerable. Wider, encroaching, parasitic, almost.</p>
<p>We claimed the last available moorage spot as the wet weather hadn’t
kept the weekend boaters away. The campsite was fairly full; a bit of
surprise given personal boats or other watercraft were the only way of
reaching the island – the Argosy boat was not running due to COVID. But
then again, there is little else to do in this time of the plague.</p>
<p>Donning our masks and backpacks, we unloaded the kids, unloosed their
life-jackets and released them to scavenge the beach and practice their
standards acts of foolery. Wet feet, dirty faces and hurt feelings
followed as expected. After a short, damp hike through large cedars,
blooming foxglove and stinging nettle taller than any of us, we packed
the boat back up for the short 15 minute ride home. Not home exactly,
but the Elliot Bay marina to be correct. Blake is great little park so
close to the city. We’ll certainly be back.</p>

<p>Leaving Jones, we had planned to head west to the postage stamp-sized
Posey Island, near Roche Harbor. The chop picked up rapidly as we
crossed San Juan Channel and we nestled down near O’Neal Island in Rocky
Bay to re-evaluate our situation. O’Neal Island is an odd little rock,
it has a home and a dock, but the drawbridge to the dock is hoisted many
tens of feet in the air, ostensibly to ward off would be pirates. A post
trip Google search showed the owner to be Ann Holquist Moss, the ex-wife
of Jerome Moss a legendary music producer and horse racing socialite.
The place looks like it doesn’t see a lot of use, likely a traded pawn
in the divorce proceedings.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_blind.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>With the weather threatening, we crossed back over the Channel to the
safety of the passage between Shaw and Orcas Islands and onward to Blind
Island. It was a rough ride. Steering a small aluminum boat via tiller
is a work out in good weather; an outright punishment on the body during
rough water. Our stop at Blind Island was hardly a stop. The south wind
prevented a clean landing, so I held our position amidst the rocks while
Erin jumped out to summit the small rock and grab the requisite photo.
If you fly right by Blind Island and don’t notice it on your ferry trip
to/from Shaw you can’t be blamed; its a rock with two picnic tables and
remnant orchard. There were homesteaders here in 1800s, one descendant
of whom lived alone here until the 1960s…doing what, it is hard to
say.</p>
<p>Our trip from Jones and our eventual ‘stop’ here showed us the
short-comings of a boat that fills the middle between one large enough
to handle 10 knot winds and one small enough to pull up onto any beach
or rock (a kayak). In good weather, with flat broad beaches, a 15 foot
aluminum boat is great for island hopping. If either of those situations
doesn’t hold, you find yourself wet, cold and stuck off shore.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>From Turn Island, we pointed our trusty float NW and headed up San
Juan Channel; destination Jones Island. Jones sits off the western edge
of much larger Orcas Island. Our trip there – just over seven miles –
took some weaving between the Yellow and Low islands group. The wind
remained minimal and there were few other boats around. The sky had not
cleared. The main point of entry for Jones is the north facing cove.
Unlike Turn, Jones has a large dock. Also unlike Turn, the place was
busy. All the dock tie-offs were occupied as well as the mooring buoys,
mostly by large, live-aboard type boats. We found a spot in the area
reserved for dinghies – our 15 ft aluminium boat qualified in relation
to the present company occupying this harbor.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_jones.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Having been in relative quarantine for nearly three weeks, it was an
odd sight to see a public place humming with activity. By and large,
most groups were social distancing-ish but there is only so much room
you give on an eight foot wide dock. Tied off we headed ashore for a
hike around the island. The sun poked through the clouds for most of our
walk which looped around the western half of the island. There were
people picnicking, the local park steward was mowing the large grassy
area and kids splashed in the water in the small beach coves. Despite it
location and the circumstances, Jones was a busy place, relative to our
previous destination and our experience in the San Juan’s for the past
three months.</p>
<p>There are some truly magnificent trees tucked into the valley in the
middle of the island. Burn scars from the days when the native used fire
to clear ground for camas, these monsters are many feet in diameter,
growing right up against the rock faces. The sun light slopes are filled
with madrona and small pockets of Garry oaks. Like Turn, the forest here
is a real attraction to those appreciative of native NW arboreal
habitats.</p>

<p>To celebrate my birthday (40), we borrowed a friend’s boat and
planned a day of island hopping in the San Juan’s. Kids ensconced with
their grandparents, we had the day to ourselves. Home to boat launch was
issue-free. Twenty years from my last boat backing experience, I was
able to reverse the boat down the launch and into the water on the first
try. Erin parked the truck and trailer while I attempted to start the
motor. I pulled for an eternity and then gave up and rowed over to the
public dock. I had likely flooded it. And old sea wolf hanging around
the dock agreed with my diagnosis. After some googling, the online crowd
of boat owners suggested trying to start it with the throttle wide open.
One pull and off we went. First destination, Turn Island.</p>
<p>The forecast called for partly cloudy. Our location was supplying the
cloudy part of the mix. The wind held light but steady from the south.
We skirted Lopez Island then SW to Turn, which hangs off the tip of San
Juan Island, not far from Friday Harbor. The tide was out, -2, and we
had an easy time pulling the boat up onto the sand beach and tying off
to a picnic table. Turn Island can get a lot of kayak traffic in the
summer, but COVID-19 has cancelled all of the tourist activities and we
had the place to ourselves.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_turn.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>With the low tide we were easily able to walk across Boat Channel and
climb up the small islet to the NW of Turn. We couldn’t stay long as we
had stumbled onto a Canadian Goose nesting site and were quickly and
loudly chased from the area. Back on the main island, we circumambulated
on the ring trail noting future camping sites and small coves to
explore. The outside of the island is rich with native madronas,
junipers and big leaf maples, giving way to large Douglas firs in the
interior. Though civilization is easy visible out across the water in
all directions, there is a certain immediate sense of adventure being on
an island all by yourselves. Turn Island may look like a small blip on
the map, but it really is a treasure of beaches, trails and picturesque
flora.</p>
<p>On our last leg of the hike, we scared up two raccoons who appeared
to have been heading for our boat (and our lunch). We had not closely
read the park guidelines on landing; “Food should be kept in secure
holds as the raccoons are intelligent and aggressive scavengers.”
Disaster averted. We untied and push off into the Sound. The motor
started on the first pull.</p>

<p>The short haul from the freeway to Tolmie State Park presents an odd
combination of land uses. The juxtapositions – distributions centers
butted up against churches, parks and small lot subdivisions – viewed
through through a seemingly endless progression of round-abouts
immediately reminded us of our days of driving through suburban
Melbourne looking for some random baseball diamond or trailhead. It is
the oddest little things that take me back there in an instant.</p>

<p>The weather had not improved from our morning trip to Millersylvania.
The chill hung in the air; visible and almost threatening. There were
other people about here. Mostly dog walkers but a few beach-combing
families like ourselves. No one went out of their way to distance from
each other in the parking lot as the initial COVID outbreak in King
County was far enough from here to be a bit out of mind.</p>
<p>We stayed long enough for a snack and a brief hunt for sea glass. The
tide was out and shore was muddy; poor conditions for true scavenging.

<p>The lake was glass; still, reflecting the gray fog that hovered just
feet above, cold and silent. This was our first post-COVID outbreak park
and the mood was appropriate, scripted almost. A bufflehead diving for a
meal broke the silence. It wasn’t reverie – positive and comforting –
nor was it necessarily worry, just a sustained sense of uncertainty that
percolates through all discussions, planning and thought recently.</p>

<p>Over the creek and through the mud, to the old growth forest we went.
Some truly impressive trees remain in the virgin tracks of forest here.
Nurse stumps and towering canopies lost in the fog. Our walk was cut
short by flooded trails, but well worth the visit. An alleged splinter
gained while throwing sticks in the creek required a minor medical (ok,
mostly psychological) intervention. The patient recovered fully.</p>
<p>Back at the car, the little one needed a drink, so Everett and I
spent some time exploring the empty park buildings – including a beer
garden near the beach – and practicing the time-honored art of nature
peeing. Suffice it to say, that at 9:30am on a cold March day we were
among the few visitors in the entire park and the only ones at the
beach.</p>

<p>A late winter day, above freezing, full of fog. A perfect day for
sledding on the beach. The sledding hill at our rental house was steep,
like fun, nearly dangerous, for adults, type steep. Almost too much for
the kids.</p>
<p>Just up the road, Lake Easton park offered more moderate options. In
fact, the best area was the beach. A perfect, consistent slope. The
ideal location for a risk-averse three year old, provided one could stop
before heading into the open water of Lake Easton.</p>
<p>The smaller one got to roll around in the snow tucked into his
hand-me down snowmobile suit. Lake Easton looks like a great summer
park, its probably nice for active adventurers in the winter too. I have
little else to say about it.</p>

<p>Late morning on a Friday in February, we were the only visitors.
Perhaps in busier months the Gem Shop just outside the park would poach
a few tourist – if for nothing other than photos with its large,
dinosaurs monuments – but its lot too was barren. Failing to properly
explain to a three-year old how a tree became a rock but still looked
like a tree, we ditched the geology for geography and went for a hike
down to the water. The small beach area, a rock pile, really, was once
home to both a ferry landing and the original bridge over the Columbia.
Today’s river is wide and slow and shallow, thanks to the Wanapum Dam.
In earlier days the bridge was shorter but the ferry ride probably
riskier due to the current. We threw rocks and scouted out the new
campground along its banks.</p>

<p>The working farm country surrounding Olmstead do not provide a
building sense of grandeur or majesty upon nearing the park. Were it not
for the signage, you’d never know it was there. On a cold but clear
Thursday afternoon in February, we were the only visitors, save some
salesman using the parking lot to take phone calls and aggressively
vape. The park was not ready for us, being locked up and fully
winterized.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_olmstead.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>After a call on nature, we made for a quick tour of the old buildings
and farm machinery. It may not have been the most exciting park to date,
but it was the most dangerous. A storm had blown many wooden shakes off
the roofs of the old building, some of which landed face down with sharp
and rusty nails facing straight up. A farm is always in need of
repair.</p>
<p>The stop was saved by the discovery of the small creek, now rushing
and bubbling from the week’s rains. A short ‘fishing’ session left the
eldest child with one wet shoe, muddy pants and inches away from a trip
down the creek. The younger one tried to eat a stick and then nearly
poked out my eye. We left shortly thereafter, miraculously intact.</p>

to Cascades Trail State Park. Not all of the sign, websites and our

on local road signs and both appear on our banner. Thus, we are double
counting this visit, if only to keep to the original 136 count of parks.
[Note: the double naming appears to hold through much of Kittitas County
as well].</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_ironhorse.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Planning to access the park from the Rattlesnake Lake/Ledge area had
us worried as the parking lots can be a downright Zoo on the weekends.
However, the heavy rain had closed Rattlesnake Ledge hike and the crowds
were minimal. We opted to visit the very end of the trail, the last 0.1
miles from the far parking lot of the Cedar River Watershed Education
Center to the building itself. It isn’t clear if this is actually even
part of the park. But it was an old rail bed and a trail and we were
hiking it so we’re going to count it – twice, in fact – for our parks
quest.</p>
<p>The Cedar River Watershed Education Center (CRWEC?) is surprisingly
worthwhile visit. We came for the outdoor water drums and the toilets,
we learned a good deal about the local watershed and the history of the
valley. There are toys for the kids and 3-D relief maps for adult-sized
geography nerds like me. I’m not certain that a museum-type visit is in
the spirit of a trail-focused State Park, but we’ll undoubtedly have to
cut some corner to get to 139; I see this as a minor cheat, if at
all.</p>

<p>It was bound to happen. We had forgotten our Discover Pass. Olallie
doesn’t have an electronic pay station and the paper passes were soaked
and illegible from last night’s rain. Though the rangers were parked
mere tens of yards away, we rolled the dice and simply left a small note
in the window describing our lack of preparedness. Perhaps the sight of
two car seats, a pram in the back and a scattering of empty apple sauces
pouches and half-eaten Goldfish would suffice in supporting our story of
the forgotten pass. A high crime for sure, but a risk we had to
take.</p>
<p>The presence and proportion of old growth along the short Weeks Falls
trail is a pleasant surprise. There are some truly spectacular Western
Red Cedars and Hemlocks within line of sight from the freeway. It is
amazing that so many survived the logger’s ax despite being located
alongside the old wooden road leading from the pass down to the coast.
We had a small snack at down by the rushing river and hustled back to
the car…we were parked, illegally, after all.</p>

<p>Joseph Whidbey did well by attaching his name to the fourth-largest

not the island’s crown jewel, overshadowed as it is by the vistas and
variety of landscape forms of its southern counterparts.</p>

<p>Or, perhaps, being the last park of the day for us, we’d given it
short shrift. We were running up against our deadline for returning home
so we had intended an in-and-out here; a visit for the sake of crossing
it off the list. Weary travelers – childless and a bit free-er than
usual – but still tired in that eternal, parents-of-young-children sort
of way.</p>
<p>There was a delay getting into the park. The main lot was full (6
spaces), but we grabbed the last remaining spot at the auxiliary lot up
the hill (3 spaces). Both other cars were empty but running. A line
formed at the toilet. Others were intending to use this park for its
bathroom facility and move on, much as we were. I jogged down a side
trail, found a prime location overlooking the flooded picnic area and
made a call on Mother Nature as the former inhabitants – The Lower
Skagit, Swinomish, Suquamish, Snohomish - did…long before Joseph (and
Peter and George) sailed the Salish Sea. On the road again.</p>

rugged shoreline. It isn’t hard – 260 ft elevation gain – but the upper
side offers the prospect of rolling down the long incline into the
lagoon and the beach hike is uneven and soft, making for slow headway.
Ah yes, but it is rewarding. A number of eagles soared overhead, fishing
and hunting in the grass and water below. The surf and tide were up,
providing that calming marine sound of rocks washing over rocks with
each retreating wave.</p>
<p>After the hike, we eventually made our way to Fort Ebey. Much larger
in size, the main attraction for day visitors are the battlements.
Having our fill of military history, we didn’t linger long. It looks
like a great place to camp in the summer, perhaps we’ll return.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Together with Fort Worden and Fort Flagler, Fort Casey provided
protection for the Puget Sound during the first half of the twenty
century. Its large battery was never used, save testing. Where Fort
Worden is grown over and end-of-world looking, Fort Casey has been kept
cleared and even repainted (partially) recently. It goes without saying
that it is a wonderful thing these fortifications were never used; the
glorious side effect of our war preparations are the amazing open spaces
and parks that we now have. Without these former bases, this land –
strategically located with amazing water views – would no doubt be
privately held, inaccessible and less environmentally managed. Silver
linings.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_fortcasey.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>The wind blew hard from the north, creating ideal kite-flying
conditions on the open field behind the battlements. Young kids reveling
in their, mostly, failed attempts to keep kites in the air. And one old
dude. Quite nearly, the Dude, Jeffrey Lebowski himself. Clad in short
and sandals, he had not only the look of 1990’s Jeff Bridges but the
mien as well. “Kids be damned, I’m going to monopolize the center of
this field with my two-handed, custom-built kite/parachute.” His
challenge was not keeping it airborne, but rather in ensuring his
flowing locks and manicured beard didn’t become entangled in the lines.
Sheer joy on his face. It takes it all kinds.</p>
<p>Erin is a lighthouse fanatic and was disappointed to find Fort
Casey’s covered in scaffolding and closed for the season. We explored
the battlements for a bit, thankfully we hadn’t spent days in the
ammunition loading room with 20 tons of explosives and a handful of
other sweaty 19-year-old men. It puts your own workplace complaints into
perspective very quickly.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Freedom! Erin’s parents had the children for the day and we had a
plan to explore Whidbey Island and check four state parks off our list.
The weather was standard February in the NW: mid 40s, cloudy with rain
about. An improvement from the drenching week we had, but a chilly day,
nonetheless. A drive to Mukilteo, a ferry to Clinton, a pit stop in
Langley for breakfast and to the first park, South Whidbey before
9:30am.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_southwhidbey.JPG" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>We were joined in the parking lot by a sports utility van. A modified
living arrangement/carrier of all manner of outdoor equipment including
mountain bike, paddle board, skis and a Thule rack bursting at the
seems. Its tri-tone exterior was covered in National Park stickers and
other advertisements of the adventurous nature of its owner(s). Here was
a true traveler. It turned out to be a young guy and his dog. The SUVan
their home for some time. If I sound a bit critical it is only out of
jealously. We, feeling young and carefree, were immediately reminded of
the relativity of our fleeting freedom. But then again, we had done this
too in days gone by, sort of, at least. Nostalgia replaced jealousy and
we headed down the trail for a short hike.</p>
<p>The mud and our big plans for the day cut this hike short. That and
the fact that the beach trail was closed due to recent flooding. We
stopped to take a selfie to send to the kids, when a large eagle swooped
down near us, creating a well-timed expression on Erin’s face as I
snapped a photo. On our way back up the trail our adventurous friend
asked, somewhat mockingly, if that was it for our hike today.
Condescending little turd. So we let all the air out of his SUVan’s
tires once we got back to the parking lot. Don’t mock us
adventure-dude.</p>
<p>Actually, we didn’t do that…but the thought crossed my mind.</p>

<p>To the mountains for our final stop of this four-park day. Traffic
was moderate, with a steady stream of late risers making their way to
Crystal Mountain for the day. The Federation Forest Interpretive Center
and main parking lot were closed. We continued on to the mud pit/pull
off area at the far eastern end of the park.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_federationforest.jpeg" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Just a short walk takes you back into the old growth forest, multiple
hundreds of years back, actually. Saved from the logger’s saw by the
General Federation of Women’s Clubs in the early 20th century, it not
pristine in the way that the Redwoods are, but inspiring
nonetheless.</p>
<p>The spongy flood plain maintained a hint of the week’s earlier
snowfall. Cold, but we were now far enough from the sea to have lost
some of that damp chill. Our progeny were generally unimpressed by the
massive trees. One had milk on his mind, the other just wanted to throw
rocks in the water. In the end, they both won out and our hike was cut
short. So great that a few of these trees still exist; so sad also.</p>

<p>A number of young families crowded the beach, children working on the
perfect cast with their Mickey/Minnie Mouse fishing poles. Ever the
observer, Everett was content just watching the young anglers. Hawkins,
wrapped in his size-much-too-large full body fur suit just wanted to
move about. So I set him on the picnic table and let him clamber around
a bit. It is possible he was mistaken for a small blue dog. It is hard
to say. Most adults at the park were too busy dodging errant hooks and
replacing missing worms to be bothered with our machinations.</p>
<p>Its a nice park. The grounds are well kept, the facilities aged in
that underfunded, heavily-used way. The information on bulletin board;
relevant but out of date. The fish were not biting, though perhaps
anglers of higher skill may have had luck. I had never been this way
before and likely never will again, but its a nice park…more than we had
expected.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Only a few miles of river separate Kanasket-Palmer and Flaming Geyser
Parks. But is a wild, cliff-lined river, not exactly amenable to road
building. Thus, driving from one to the other is a 20 minute, sinuous
affair.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_kanaskatpalmer.JPG" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Thought it wasn’t much warmer, it was snack time so we settled down
into a small ‘beach’ area near the river to eat. A mud flat, really. The
river was mad with January rain, rushing over the exposed rocks and
almost over the far bank. Nearly as mad as the two kayakers who came
hurling down it minutes later. It looked like a wild ride, but they
navigated the rapids with ease and were quickly on their way.</p>
<p>As with our earlier stop, we pretty much had the park to ourselves.
In the city, dog-walkers keep parks busy from sun-up to sunset. Out
here, the parks serve a different purpose and campers are thin this time
of year. The collection of empty spaces that are equipped for crowds –
shelter, picnic tables, toilets and parking lots – gives an end of the
world type feeling. The steel gray sky aiding the aura of doom.</p>

<p>After a crooked route into the Green River Gorge, we crossed a very
modern bridge and followed the main route to park next to a not-so
modern building. Fire was once the main draw, but that flame had slowly
weakened to nothing over the years. Water was now the attraction. Access
to the Green River, to be exact. It had rained heavily the night before
so the ground was laden, the small creek and the river itself flowing
fast. Water in the air too. That damp Northwest cold that no jacket or
wind-break can possibly shield you from. It cuts right to the bone. I
grew up in Wisconsin and I’d gladly take a 20 degree sunny day there
over the damp, low-40s chill we get here.</p>
<p>Geyser is a misnomer. It is pipe drilled 1,300 feet into the ground
originally intended to prospect for coal. They found a methane seam, lit
it aflame and it burned for decades. Once many feet high, then many
inches, now not at all. The park has been re-purposed from spectacle to
recreational and it is much better for it. We peered at the faded
hydrocarbon darling, caught a feint whiff of methane from down deep and
hustled back to the car. We had more parks to see.</p>

<p>Upon arrival our three year old asked: “Where’s the beach?”. We
hadn’t realized it until then, but this was our first non-beach park
visit on this quest. It was also our first joint visit, as the
Michener-Malcolm family joined us for a hike. Hike is a generous term.
More like short, slow walk in the woods with small children. There’s a
lot of stops, some whining, stick-play, one face-plant in the mud, some
snacks, more whining. We made it multiple miles (2.0) with a few hundred
feet of elevation gain all without any major incidents. A small steps on
the long journey to reclaiming our once-defining outdoor lifestyle.</p>
<p>Back at the parking lot the fun truly began for the younger
generation. Puddles from last night’s rain abounded and none were left
unexplored. No boots, socks or pants remained dry either. Toddlers
entertaining themselves for 15 minutes is well worth the trouble. Young
families were filing in as we packed up to leave. A ‘hiking with kids’
Meetup we were told. Our timing was impeccable. Two kids on the trail is
manageable, two dozen is disaster.</p>

<p>  A few miles down the road from Cama Beach is Camano Island State
Park. In place of the small cabins and structured sea wall is a wilder
coast as the campgrounds and main park buildings are situated upland and
away from the water.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_camanoisland.JPG" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>The beach here has a more southerly aspect. Better for sun-bathing on
a summer day, but headlong into today’s stiff breeze. 49 felt like 29 as
the wind-driven waves pounded the shoreline in front of us. The Olympics
and the Cascades, both currently snow-covered, are visible from the
parking lot as its orientation points you directly down the Puget Sound
and gap between the two. From some vantage points in Western Washington
the ranges look distant; from here the Sound looks so very narrow.</p>
<p>Everett and I found a makeshift driftwood fort which we requisitioned
and remodeled into a frontier shell store (and general mercantile). I
was assigned shell collection duty whilst my partner manned the
storefront. Resources were plentiful and soon our shelves were stocked.
Few paying customers, however, on a day like today. The big win was
convincing the store owner to leave behind his goods for the next
kid.</p>

<p>A re-purposed fishing resort from the 1930s, the defining features of
Cama Beach are man-made. The small cabins, wooden boat museum and park
support offices sit tightly clustered in a (mostly) automobile-free
community right on the beach. New urbanism meets wilderness outpost
meets Airbnb. Though the buildings had been restored and some modern
conveniences added, on this steel gray day it wasn’t hard to imagine the
resort in full swing during the 1930s. Shellfish and the day’s catch
being unloaded and cleaned, wood fires burning, whiskey swilled and
spilled.</p>
<p>Being a holiday weekend, some of the cabins had been inhabited the
night before and some life stirred in this little waterfront
‘community’. We found a mostly wind-sheltered location to drop a picnic
blanket and lunch. We didn’t last long, barely enough to eat before the
damp wind drove us back up the hill and to the car.</p>

<p><img src="waparks_files/figure-html/deception_pass-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>  Deception Pass is both natural spectacle and monument to human
engineering. Tidal ebbs and flows rush through the narrow channel at
upwards of 10 mph – a marine river; audible and visually striking –
beneath the double span bridge nearly 200 feet above. There’s more than
just that: salt and freshwater beaches, multiple lakes and miles of
hiking trails.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_deceptionpass.JPG" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>I had been here before on a hungover morning back in 2005. In such a
state, walking along the bridge turned out to be a poor idea and I had
turned back without completing it. This time two young children
presented another reason to pass on the attempt at a pedestrian
crossing. It is a very narrow walkway, separated from speeding traffic
on one side by an iron cable and from a 180-foot fall to you death by a
4-foot high railing on the other. Parents, the feint of heart and the
clumsy need not apply.</p>
<p>We had been at the beach for no more than five minutes when the
oldest’s feet were swamped from behind by a rogue wave. At once both
Erin and I scolded: ‘Never turn your back on the sea’. Some significant
part of marriage (and parenting) is about becoming the same person. Most
of the other part of marriage (and parenting) seems to be about becoming
your own parents.</p>
<p>The amphitheater had a compass rose stamped in the concrete. Clever
parent that I am, I took the opportunity to explain the cardinal
directions to a 3-year old. I was utterly defeated. ‘Why is East East?’.
That is a good damn question and one I could not answer. End of science

<p>  The second park on our first (hopefully of many) multiple park day.
One failed park visit already on the books, we would not be denied here.
It was raining. So, we geared up and hit the beach. Temperature, 43
degrees. We had brought neither the beach toys nor the rugged and
waterproof pram.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_dashpoint.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>Fortune shined on us even though the sun would not. Everett found two
discarded sifters on the beach and we were able to fashion our picnic
blanket into a make-shift umbrella/tent for Hawkins. The little one
didn’t last long outside, but Everett and I collected, cleaned and piled
shells until we were soaked.</p>
<p>The hardest part, often, is just getting out of the car. Kids have no
problem racing off to play in the rain. Its as if they don’t even notice
it such is their focus on the task at hand (play). Its a good lesson;
one that us adults would do well to remember. I’m proud of us for
braving the weather, the closure and overcoming the instinct to pack it
in when it became a little uncomfortable. If one is going to do this
thing right — the parks quest, parenting, life, everything, really — a
little fortitude and child-like abandon is necessary.</p>
<p>Getting ready to leave the parking lot, there were three families
preparing to do a polar plunge. Just when you think you’ve gone off and
won the day, someone will show up and put you in your place. Humility,
don’t forget the humility.</p>

<p>‘So, too much poop?’. That was our 3-year-old’s summation of our
explanation of why Saltwater State Park was closed on our arrival. The
torrential rains earlier in the week had caused sewer overflow runoff to
contaminate some of the low-lying areas, thus leading to the park’s
closure. Our poor research efforts this morning had failed to uncover
these developments. After reading the full announcement from the park’s
website (while parked in front of the locked gate), the response from
the back seat was ‘So, too much poop?’</p>

<p>  A front had moved through last night and gone was the balmy 50+
degrees. In its place a biting wind and threatening clouds. Still early
in our State Parks quest and full of vim, vigor and a general dread of
being shut up for the entire day, we decided to have a go at Lake
Sammamish State Park. The choice of destination was a hedge, however.
Lake Sammamish Park is (sub)urbanly-located meaning if the weather drove
us off, we could still fulfill a number of other errands without much
additional travel.</p>

<p>The weather had kept the crowds at bay and the massive parking lot
was mostly empty. The few humans about were walking their dogs. The main
park structure, playground and associated grounds had recently been
re-done, a marked change from the standard worn picnic tables and
cramped toilets. The sense of public investment — crisp design, new
structures, clean surrounds — was reminiscent of our time in Melbourne.
Our stay at the park was short; in which we took turns speed-walking the
stroller around to stay warm. The big hit was the large plastic spoon
that was found and used to fling mud at the resident ducks.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes from our house, Saint Edward is our most quickly and
easily accessible state park. The journey was rather uneventful, few
people other than parents and, perhaps, athletes-in-training venture out
on the roadways at eight-thirty AM on New Years Day. The park, however,
was full. Heaping full of young families like our own. In addition to
the trails and old seminary building there is a massive, Sherwood
Forest-themed playground. Actually, child-castle would be a better
description.</p>
<p><img src="images/waparks_saintedward.png" style="width:25%; border:1px solid; margin-left:20px; margin-right: 20px" align="right"></p>
<p>We opted first for a hike to the lake and back. The Grotto Trail
descends quickly to the water, past hanging moss and radial sword ferns,
but oddly, not past the Grotto. Though a much promised attraction, we
did not back-track to find it. Our 3-year old rated the hike “Bad: too
many mud and roots”. The beach area also lacked enough “sticks for
throwing in the water.” His complaints were duly noted and filed with
the park ranger.</p>
<p>Post-hike, we entered the melee at the playground. Time was passed
silently judging the disciplining techniques of other parents and taking
mental notes of design ideas for the tree house we are building at the
in-laws. In the parking lot we were accused of being Australian — due to
our kids being suited in Bonds clothing — by another couple that had
also lived in Melbourne a few years back. We chatted briefly and were on
our way home. Within the bustle of daily life we often forget about our
past Australian adventure. Little coincidences like this bring it front
and center and remind us of: 1) How amazing it was; and 2) Why we refuse
to let our intrepid fire die. Smolder as it may during through these

<p>The steel gray, bone-chilling damp days had returned. The eldest
child was lured from the house with promises of a beach and eagles and a
log cabin and some snacks. All of these were available, or at least
possible, at Spencer Spit — the to-be first stop of our WA Parks
Challenge. We had been here many times, in fact, Erin had worked here as
a junior park ranger during high school. It seemed right to take the
first step on our home turf.</p>
<p>The highlight of journey — an eight minute drive — was seeing a white
cat perched on a utility box. No tantrums, no detours, no arguments; a
solid first step.</p>
<p>But…the park was closed for the season. We had stumbled out of the
gate. Or maybe not. This was our Challenge, we made the rules and the
rules became only that we had to get a photo of the entrance sign.
Physical presence within the park boundary is enough to check the box.
It is important to get a thing like this started and important to set
expectations. It certainly won’t be the only time we run into a ‘Park
Closed’ sign; now we have precedent. Case law, if you will. Plus, we’ll
likely be back here many times before we visit all the others.</p>
