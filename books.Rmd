#### [How To: Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real World Problems](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/576760/how-to-by-randall-munroe/): 

&nbsp;

- By : Randall Munroe

&nbsp;

A decade ago, around a campfire, after many beers, we pondered the horizontal pressure of an above ground swimming pool. How much force does the water exert and was it greater for a large but shallow pool or a tall, but small (in circumference) one. Related, is it more difficult to displace water in a small versus a large pool?  While we did not answer those questions that night, we did successfully melt an aluminum can and boil water in a paper cup.  If you’ve ever wondered these type of wonders or experimented these type of experiments then this is your kind of book (the pool question is covered, btw).  Basically a ‘deeply-researched and somewhat obscene answers to questions you are usually too sober or too embarrassed to ask’ book.   

Munroe is the author of the XKCD comic strip; well known in some circles, likely unheard of in most.  Here he presents legit science wrapped up in similar dry humor.  There are equations, but if you skip them you won’t miss anything.  There are also drawings, which shouldn’t be passed over.  The formula is: 1) Insert somewhat innocuous question about how to do a standard human thing; 2) Take said question to the extreme; and 3) Supported extreme answer with math and jokes.  And it works.  Rare is the book that can handle Kant and Evil Knievel in successive chapters.  

What else is covered?  Popular Culture: Is the dig at Oak Island worth it?; Popular Wisdom: Is ‘red at night’ really a delight?; and Popular Mechanics: How to best disable a flying drone.  If you still aren’t convinced, you’ll learn how far you can actually throw a given object…and for that alone you should crack the cover.

Online reviews of this book range from “Dude, totally best book ever” to “This book is a poorly done 'Buddhism for Bros'”.  I fall somewhere in the middle.  It contains useful wisdom, wrapped, occasionally a bit overly so, in modern context and lexicon.  The title — clearly a marketing win — sets the expectations of readers; which depending on how far down the self-help (or Psychology PhD) path one has trod could be a positive or negative push.  

I took the following from this book, presented in what I gathered was the author's line of reasoning:

* Stop worrying about unimportant things (giving a fuck).  We all have a limited set of things we can care about, make yours count because:
* Everyone has problems. The goal of life should be to have good problems. ‘Good’ in the sense that you enjoy working on their solutions because:
* Human happiness stems not from having money/fame/power but from solving problems.  To the extent that these things can help you solve good problems they are means, but not the end.  *But I don’t choose my own problems...Wait, do I?* 
* Our values define our success metrics which in turn help determine which problems we encounter and are working (or maybe not) to overcome. Thus, set good values and good problems will result. *Ok, so what is a ‘good' value?*
* Good values have two features: 1) They are internally operable; they do not require external acceptance; and 2) They are process-oriented, not result-oriented (such values often violate #1). *Can I tell which of the values that meet these criteria I should pursue?* 
* What determines your success at fulfilling your values and solving their associated problems is whether or not you are willing to endure (enjoy) the suffering (work) it takes to express that value.  Essentially, you need to envision what work it would take to achieve this value (to solve the problems associated with that value) and ask yourself very honestly if you enjoy the process, the practice, the suffering, the work — all of the negative aspects -- that it would take to reach this goal.  If not, you won’t be successful. 
* In short: Stop chasing positive rewards, critically assess your values, learn to enjoy the negative (work) associated with solving problems and quit worrying about unimportant shit along the way. 

This is all, of course, aimed at well-to-do, existentially-confused young westerners whose problems do not include access to clean water, malaria, famine, war, despotism and other life threatening circumstances.  It is a quick read and, for those of us lucky enough to have some say in what we ‘give a fuck about’, a worthwhile reminder of the importance of setting the right values and in putting in the work necessary to nurture, express and live those values.

#### [Prisoners of Geography](https://www.audible.com/pd/Prisoners-of-Geography-Audiobook/B01MFBS0ZZ): 

&nbsp;

- By Tim Marshall

&nbsp;

Don’t let the title fool you, this is as much or more of a history book than a geography book.  While the book is organized into chapters based on ’10 maps that explain the world’, with a few exceptions, there is almost a complete lack of interesting or useful maps to help the narrative.  The ’10 maps’ are simply ten countries/regions of focus — each presented with a very standard political geography map.  I spent no small amount of time referencing Google Maps during my reading and feel a sizable contribution of this book could have been in clearly locating (mapping) the forces driving each country's decisions, both past and present.  

The tagline here should be ‘selected geopolitics of the 20th and early 21st century’.  With that aim in mind, it is a successful book: approachable, yet detailed.  An undergraduate modern world history seminar could do well by assigning this as a supplemental reader.  A few notable themes that emerge: 1) The disastrous consequences of colonial powers drawing borders without regard for historical settlement patterns; 2) The extractive development of the Southern Hemisphere leading to large coastal capitals and underdeveloped hinterlands; and 3) The continued importance of proximity in diplomacy (Moscow is near, Washington is far).  

Many of the (assumed) political motivations are discussed under the umbrella of energy politics.  Either I’m naive about the supremacy of energy in driving (geo)politics or this book takes an overly simplistic view.  Truthfully, a mass market non-fiction book probably cannot do justice to the full suite of considerations; nonetheless, Marshall leaves the reader feeling as if the sole determinant of a state’s actions are oil and natural gas.  Barring the final chapter on the Arctic, climate and ecological issues are given short shrift. Technological capital and labor markets are thinly discussed as well.  Again, perhaps state machinations really are primarily driven by the quest for hydrocarbons…and if so, it would explain the world’s reluctance to address climate change and support alternative energy solutions.  

All in, it is a quick and worthwhile read.  Many factoids and smaller points of information may surprise — ex. the British traded their overseas bases to the Americans for warships in 1940 — while the general themes are broad and, somewhat evident.  I was left with a sense of foreboding; a collision between the US and China in the Pacific seems imminent as does Russia’s dominance of the Arctic.  Geography may end up being a cruel jailor.
