<h3><strong>Day 0: The Longest Day (or Three)</strong></h3>
<div id="suva-fiji" class="section level4">
<h4>Suva, Fiji</h4>
<p>Technically October 9th began at Justin’s house in Tucson and ended
somewhere over the Pacific Ocean, however, for me it stretched all the
way to my landing in Fiji early on the morning of October 11th.</p>
<p>First off, a big thanks to Ed for letting me drive his truck down to
the airport. The flight to LA from Tucson was rather nondescript, with
the mild exception of flying over that accidental oasis, the Salton Sea.
After gathering my baggage and bussing it to the Bradley Terminal, I was
immediately accosted by a group of Mormon missionaries upon entering the
food court. They were quickly shoed away, only to attack a nearby
elderly couple. If I had it my way Evangelism would be illegal at the
airport.</p>
<p>I lucked out on the flight to Fiji and had an empty seat between me
and my rowmate, Rahim. Rahim works as a shelf stocker for Costco in
Oakland six months out of the year, the other half he spends back in
Fiji. He was a friendly, older man, who turned into a whiny bitch after
he didn’t get the special Muslim meal that he ordered. He verbally
berated the flight attendant, who had no control over the situation, for
about 15 minutes. Finally, one of the flight attendants sacrificed her
fish meal just so he would shut up. When his breakfast came with a
sausage in it, the same process was repeated.</p>
<p>I slept on and off for about half of the flight. It was my first time
on a double-decker 747 and the leg room was plenty adequate. The media
options were rather poor, but the service was excellent. We crossed the
equator southwest of Hawaii at 2:46 local time (whatever time zone we
were in). A few hours later we crossed the International Date Line, and
my nearly non-existent Wednesday, October 10th passed into the dark
ocean night.</p>
<p>We landed in Nadi, Fiji at 5:10 local time. Stepping out of the plane
I was greeted by the rising sun and perfectly still, warm, heavy
tropical air. Inside the terminal a band of Fijian men in skirts struck
up a tune for us. I lay down on the floor of the airport for a quick nap
thus ending one of the longest days of my life.</p>
<p><strong>What I Learned Today</strong>: <em>Bula is Fijian for Hello,
Danaka for Thank You</em></p>

<div id="day-1-touchdown-in-australia" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Day 1: Touchdown in Australia</strong></h3>
<div id="brisbane-australia" class="section level4">
<h4>Brisbane, Australia</h4>
<p>I landed in Brisbane around 11:30 local time, and was free from the
rigors of customs by noon. Stepping outside was similar to stepping into
a sauna. It felt like New Orleans in March, minus the pervasive smell of
stale urine and sour milk. A man on the train told me that they’ve been
getting some torrential rains the last few weeks, which has led to the
uncustomarily high level of humidity. I hope he’s right. The Brisbane
City Backpacker’s Hostel was about a ¼ mile walk from the train station.
Half way there I was soaked. The evaporative cooling powers of sweat are
greatly minimized when the relative humidity hits 90%. It is sort of
like trying to fit a third corn-fed Minnesota girl into the back of a
Volkswagen; there just isn’t any more room for her (or the water) to
go.</p>
<p>Checked into my room to find the two inhabitants already there were
busy speaking German. I waited for a while, to make sure they weren’t
talking about how they hate dirty Americans, and then calmly asked them
in German where the shower was. Looks of pleasant surprise fell over
their faces, especially when they learned that I was from the US. I
think they were amazed that anyone from the States knew German. After
swapping stories, it turns out one of them was from Poland, the other
from Germany. Our final roommate showed, a Czech named Vladimir, who
also spoke German. Though in the end, English won out, likely due to
mine and Vlad’s poor Deutsch. Everyone went their separate ways, with me
heading back to the train station to get an AC adapter. The voltage in
Australia is the same; it is just that the top two prongs are turned at
45 degree angles.</p>
<p>Upon returning to the hostel, I promptly crashed and slept until 6.
Quite a surprise to me, the sun was setting at the 6 o’clock hour as I
awoke. I took a walk downtown to find some cheap food. While Brisbane is
most certainly a 20th century, automobile-centric city, the traffic is
beautifully quiet. In over an hour of walking, I heard one or two horns
at the most and not a single siren. I eventually ran into the Queens
Street pedestrian mall. Imagine a packed mall, three blocks long, full
of bars in the middle and stores on the outside, all exposed to the
great outdoors. Needless to say, a great place for a stroll and some
people watching. I eventually found a grocery store in the underground
level of the mall. Prices were somewhat similar to back home, though it
seems meat is bit pricier and the selection of fruit isn’t quite as
expansive. I settled on bananas and the old standby, granola bars (or
muesli bars as is the nomenclature here down under.)</p>
<p>Returned to the hostel and headed to the lounge to return some emails
and work on the blog. The room was packed with most of the inhabitants
were mesmerized by the Simpsons on the TV. The bar downstairs was full,
but not overly packed. As much as I desired to find my roommates and
have a beer or six, it was already 9pm, I could hardly keep my eyes
open, I was over my $50 per diem, and I really needed a good sleep
(Monday night was my most recent horizontal sleep.), so I headed to bed
around 10pm…there will be plenty of opportunities in the next six months
to belly up to a bar, that and I am due at the volunteer office at 10
tomorrow morning. A pretty calm first day, which I needed. The jet lag
isn’t as bad as flying to Europe, but I still feel a bit off.</p>
<p><strong>What I Learned Today</strong>: <em>It is tough to jaywalk in
a place where the cars are coming from the wrong direction. I probably
crossed 35 crosswalks in my travels today and I still look the wrong way
for traffic every time. Thus, in the name of safety, I’ve taken to
waiting for the little green man.</em></p>

<div id="day-2-meeting-the-team" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Day 2: Meeting The Team</strong></h3>
<div id="brisbane-australia-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Brisbane, Australia</h4>
<p>I awoke early today, as usual, and spent the first few hours of the
morning using what I would later learn to have been some of my last free
wireless internet access for some time. Checked out of the Brisbane City
Backpackers around 9 am and headed east over the William Jolly Bridge to
the South Bank, and eventually on to the Conservation Volunteers’ Home
Office. We were to arrive at 11am, I showed up at 9:30 and they weren’t
quite ready for me, so I dropped my pack and took a wander through the
South Bank Parklands, a verdant, beach-ish park along the south bank of
the Brisbane River. I came upon a pedestrian bridge over the river to
the City Botanical Gardens on the north bank near downtown. A beautiful
city park, no doubt. By far the most interesting part was the elevated
boardwalk through a partially-submerged mangrove forest.</p>
<p>Made my way back to the office by 10:45 to find two of my fellow
volunteers had already arrived; Mandy, a mid to late 30s, British woman
from a little town near Manchester. I came to find out that she sold all
of her belongings in April and has been traveling the world volunteering
ever since. The other prompt team member Peter (Hu Wuan), a mathematics
student from South Korea. Minutes later, our fourth and final member of
our group, Daniel, a mid-20s fellow also from England, arrived. We were
painfully subjected to the obligatory safety video and orientation
session and then broke for lunch to get to know each other a little bit.
My first actual meal in Australia was a delicious salmon/chickpea
sandwich with cream cheese. At first, $10 AUS might seem a bit pricey
for a sandwich, but once you figure that tax is already included and
tips are not expected, it seems fairly reasonable…now if only the dollar
weren’t so weak – the Europeans definitely have an advantage over here.
We returned and were whisked away to the volunteer house, our place of
lodging while we weren’t out in the field. FYI: The first time you ride
in a right side driver’s car, especially in the front seat, is a bit of
a scare. Our digs are located in Albion, a northern suburb, about 5
train stops from downtown. The place is an old Queenstown house (which
meant nothing to me until I saw it) consisting of an amalgamation of
rooms and covered porches that appear to have been added in the most
haphazard of manners over the past 100 years. The 12 foot ceilings,
decorative woodworking, and maze-like floor plan do offer a certain bit
of charm, however. It lacks air-conditioning and insulation of any kind,
so the days are hot and the nights cool as wind seems to blow straight
through the place. The house consists of two women’s rooms, two men’s
rooms, a caretaker’s room, kitchen, two baths, a laundry, and various
lounges and dens. The back yard has a small courtyard. I am rooming with
Daniel and Peter this week, though as volunteers come and go we’ve been
warned that room assignments are likely to change.</p>
<p>Around 3pm the other crew of volunteers returned from their weekly
assignment in Noosa. In this group were Matt, a 31-year old from Wales,
Aaron a 19-year old student from New Hampshire, Jana (pronounced Yana),
a cute little, 20-year old from Berlin, Germany, Anna a youngster from
Tasmania, and Lena, a mid-40s women from somewhere, though judging by
her misappropriation of pronouns and poor verb conjugation, somewhere
English is not the primary language. Apparently a few more souls will be
filtering in over the weekend.</p>
<p>Our volunteer program is set up so that we spend the weekends here in
Brisbane and each Monday, or sometimes Sunday, we are put into groups
and taken to our place of work. We stay at the volunteer work site until
Friday afternoons and then return to Brisbane for the weekend. The best
part is that we can leave things at the house during the week, so we do
not need to haul all of our possessions out into the wild. While at the
house, they provide all the food, all we have to do is cook it and clean
up after ourselves. We’ve received our first assignment already; this
Sunday, Daniel, Aaron, Jana, Mandy and Glen(?) and I leave at 8 am on
Sunday morning for a 6 hour drive to Expedition National Park on the
other side of the mountains in what is considered the Queensland
outback. We’ll be camping out in the wild until Friday morning, so for
anyone reading this, you’ll likely not get another update from me until
next Friday at the earliest.</p>
<p>After some time chatting with the new volunteers, or volleys as we
are known, Matt, Aaron, Jana, and I took off for Cambridge Street to do
a bit of shopping and grab a pint or two. Cambridge Street is a bit of a
poor man’s Queen’s Street Pedestrian Mall. The shops are dirty and
cheaper, the pubs more abundant and every block a few peep shows tuck
themselves into small nooks and upstairs spaces. My kinda place. After
the young kids grabbed some smokes, we settled on The Elephant and
Wheelbarrow, advertised as a traditional English Pub. Having never been
into a traditional English Pub, who was I to argue with this
proclamation? Had two pints of Toohey’s, which tasted a bit like
Leinenkugel’s Original.</p>
<p>On the return trip I had my first run in with the Aussie law. Earlier
I had errantly purchased an off-peak train ticket, which means it was
not good from 3pm to 7pm. We boarded the train back to the house at 6:58
and wouldn’t you know it, immediately two transit officers stepped on
board to check our tickets. When he saw mine and said “This is an
off-peak ticket”, I responded in my best confused tourist, American
accent “you mean it isn’t 7pm?”. He looked at his watch and said, “you
are two minutes early, don’t worry about and don’t do it again.” I am
such a badass.</p>
<p><strong>What I Learned Today</strong>: <em>The first five minutes you
meet someone tells you all you ever need to know about them…well almost
everything, usually. Six hours in and I appear to be spot on with
everyone. Makes me wonder what they all think about me. The interesting
part about this volunteering arrangement is that each Friday people come
and go, so I’ll get to try out this little psycho/socio-logical
experiment every week.</em></p>

<h3><strong>Day 3: Prepping for our First Adventure</strong></h3>
<div id="brisbane-australia-2" class="section level4">
<h4>Brisbane, Australia</h4>
<p>Still not quite on Aussie time, as I awoke with sun at 5:30 am. No
sense wasting a beautiful morning lying in bed and listening to the
trains roll by the Albion Station, so I got up and went for a walk. I
headed east and found the little shopping center technically called
Woolowin. It has a grocery store, a Bi-Lo (whatever the hell that is), a
Blockbuster, numerous real estate offices, but most importantly, a
St. Vincent de Paul’s. I’ll be headed there later today to buy some work
shirts and a large sun hat, plus whatever cheap garb I can get my hands
on.</p>
<p>Later on, my trip to St. Vinnie’s was a total bust. Some very nice $6
dress shirts were plentiful. There were also four racks of women’s
belts, a whole bin of cassette tapes for $1, and a special section of
stuffed animals, but anything remotely resembling a men’s work quality
shirt was nowhere to be found. I returned to the house empty handed.
After lunch, Peter and I jumped the train downtown to try to find some
free internet at one of the libraries and for me to finish my shopping.
(Note: The ticket men at the Albion station could be the most unhappy
people on the planet, I guess calling out “The Shorncliffe Line will be
arriving on Platform 4 in three minutes” all day can really take its
toll.)</p>
<p>The city library on the north bank, though a beautiful building, was
useless to a tourist. One needed a library card to do anything,
including going to the bathroom. Across the river the State Library
proved quite a bit more fruitful. The information center on the first
floor was packed with people on laptops and others waiting in the queues
for a free 20 minute online session on the provided desktop computers.
While the wireless was free, it was terribly slow, and though I was able
to answer some email and post a blog entry, I could not upload photos
nor view any such content. What should have taken me 30 minutes, took 3
hours. I need to find a better place to get a free connection, or just
break down and pay for it somewhere.</p>
<p>We then headed to Target in the Queen’s Street Mall underground.
Within 2 minutes of being in the store I had lost Peter, not an easy
thing to do considering the tall, skinny Korean was wearing a black and
white Where’s Waldo-ish hat. After a few laps I gave up on him, figuring
he had either went his own way or been decapitated by the samurai clad
man who was hanging out in Housewares section. Either way, I could have
been no further help, so I carried on with my afternoon. I felt a bit
bad, because his English is marginal and he got lost yesterday and had
to take a cab home, but I got over it. I eventually found some suitable
work shirts at the Big W on sale for $10. A pretty good deal considering
my little tube of Carmex cost me $4.75. My advice to anyone coming to
Australia: stock up on cosmetics, they are double or triple the price
over here.</p>
<p>Returned home to do some reading and took a nap. In the evening we
had a large communal spaghetti dinner. Afterwards everyone took their
turn emptying their camera memory cards onto my computer. We are going
to get some DVDs this week so I can burn everyone a disk at the end of
the volunteer session. Most people, like myself, are staying over here
for at least a few months, some more, and photos seem to accumulate
pretty quickly in a beautiful place like this. Turns out my laptop will
be a savior to more people than just myself.</p>
<p><strong>What I Learned Today</strong>: <em>Spending a day with
someone whose English isn’t the greatest teaches you to clean up your
vernacular slang and poor enunciation habits. I don’t know how many
times with Peter I had to rephrase something because I was speaking in
Midwest slang or uttering nonsense out of the corner of my mouth. Also,
it is really funny listening to him pronounce his Ls as Rs. New Zealand
becomes New Zearand, library is ribrary, etc. If you think the girl from
Lost in Translation was exaggerating, she wasn’t.</em></p>
<p>PS: Speaking of language issues, yesterday Matt, the funny guy from
Wales, was telling a story about him and his brother’s trip around New
South Wales and Victoria in a camper van, when he managed to use the
words Wanker, Tosser, and Bloody Fucking Bollocks all in the same
sentence. Classic fucking British (or Welsh, rather).</p>

<h3><strong>Day 4: In Search of Reedy Creek Ranch</strong></h3>
<div id="taroom-australia" class="section level4">
<h4>Taroom, Australia</h4>
<p>Our team leader John arrived around 7 o’clock this morning to begin
packing up the troupee(basically a modified Jeep with seating for eight
in the rear) and the trailer for our long haul to Expedition National
Park. Involved with myself in this week long adventure were Daniel,
Jana, Aaron, Mandy,Glen, our leader John and an illegal sidekick Brian.
Glen turned out to be a local guy whose conservation studies mandated 80
hours of volunteer work. Twenty something, with a Mohawk and army
fatigue pants, Glen cast himself as a bit of a harrowing character at
first glance, however, after meeting him, his smile gave away his true
nature; that of a quiet, hard-working fellow. Team Leader John, was an
ex-oil geologist turned outdoorsman, who could have been old man Jackl’s
twin, in both looks and demeanor. Brian, our stowaway, on the other
hand, was quite the opposite, a Jeckl to John’s Hyde. Numerous tattoos,
including BEER – one letter on each of the four fingers of his left hand
– and a few scars spoke of a misspent youth that carried over a bit too
far into adulthood. He was rather small and gaunt, about 5’5”, 150
pounds soaking wet, and had a manner of speech and movement incredibly
similar to John Diemel. After hearing the first dozen stories out of his
mouth, I decided that was exactly what he was: an Australian version of
my hometown neighbor, Mr. Diemel. Oh yeah, the reason I say Brian was an
illegal sidekick is that though he is a usual team leader about six
months ago he was weed-eating when he took off his glasses to wipe some
sweat and the end of the weed-eater hit the ground and kick a piece of
metal directly into his eye. It went through the front and lodged itself
in the retina. Four surgeries later, he is still wearing a patch, is on
limited duty and isn’t supposed to be working, but boredom has got the
best of him so he decided to ride along for free.</p>
<p>Introductions and packing finished, we hid the road for what was to
be an estimated six hour drive. The first hour and half was spent
climbing the range up to the city of Toowoomba. On our climb up the
steep grade we passed an old, bright pink car carrying two young girls
struggling up the hill. Glancing over we spotted a large plastic dildo
glued to the dashboard. The girls looked up, smiled and waved. We nearly
drove in the ditch from laughter. Home of Queenstown University (or
something like that), Toowoomba is a nice little college town perched on
the edge of a plateau. We stopped for a quick stretch. The seats in the
back of the troupee will numb even the fattest of asses in the first
thirty minutes. After Toowoomba, the terrain levels out quickly. This is
cattle country. Were we not driving on the left side of the road, one
could fall asleep, awake and think you were smack dab in the center of
Nebraska. A small town dots the map every 50 to 70 miles, all of them
identical to the one before it. Around noon, we pulled off in the town
of Chinchilla for lunch and our first taste of the coming annoyance
known as harvest flies. A notch smaller than the common American
housefly, what they lack in size they more than make up for in tenacity.
A strange casual observation: each of these small farm towns has a skate
park, and not one of them was in use.</p>
<p>At Miles, we turned north towards Taroom. The table-flat farmland
began to give way to rolling hills, some pasture, most in their native
scrub grass and savanna-like foliage. A few kilometers past Taroom we
hung a left onto Robinson Creek Road, a red dirt road. This would be the
last time we would see pavement (or bitumen as the Aussies call it) for
days. For about a 100 KMs we bounced along in the back of the troupee
dodging potholes, branches and the occasional kangaroo or wallaby. We
came upon a fork in the road, and as Yogi Berra suggested, we took it.
Actually, we hung a left, following (rather errantly as we would soon
discover) the sign pointing toward Expedition National Park. Fifty
kilometers later the end of the road appeared, with the Starkvite
Campground to the right. Not where we were scheduled to say. Upon
thieving a map from the campground, it was discovered that the
directions we had been given were wrong and we had taken a left when we
should have went right. A bout two hours, three more turnarounds, one
blue refrigerator and one bleached out road sign later, we arrived at
the Reedy Creek Ranch, our intended destination. The trip took nine
hours, eight of them on the road…much too long in the back of the
troupee. As it was already dusk, John cooked a quick meal of jammers and
mashies (hot dogs and mashed potatoes). The place is off the grid and
the generator goes off at nine, so we unpacked our sleeping bags and
headed to sleep on the veranda. Due to the Adrian’s (the owner) pervish
tendencies the girls were allowed to sleep inside, us men were stuck
under the stars.</p>
<p><strong>What I Learned Today</strong>: <em>Those of us who live in
cities are missing out on one of the world’s great wonders: the night
sky. Here at Reedy Creek Ranch, miles from any light pollution, the full
breadth of the stars are on display. Though it is not the northern sky
that I am so familiar with, its magnificence is not in the least bit
diminished. I fear that there are many among us who have never truly
seen the night sky in all its splendor, and what a shame that
is.</em></p>

<div id="taroom-australia-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Taroom, Australia</h4>
<p>As usual I was up at dawn. Along my morning walk, I kicked up
numerous wallabies and two large grey kangaroos who had come near the
homestead in order to drink from the retaining pond located near the
creek. Attempts to accurate photograph these creatures were futile.</p>
<p>The Reedy Creek Ranch is an interesting place. First settled in the
late 1800s by an Irish family, the place has seen numerous owners in the
past forty years. Back in the 1970s it was a thriving Jackaroo ranch
(basically a training ranch for wannabe cowboys). After that it spent
some time as a bed and breakfast. Shortly thereafter most of the land
was sold to the state. Currently it is being run as a viable cattle
ranch, with most of the pasture land leased back from the state. This
abbreviated history of the ranch was told to us by Adrian, the current
owner. A portly, balding man in his early 60s, Adrian looks more like a
retired insurance agent that the operator of a massive ranch in the
middle of the Queensland bush. Later in the day we met Stan, the man who
runs the day to day operations. Stan looks, acts, and speaks the part of
a rancher, ten gallon hat and all. The ranch buildings are aging and in
desperate need of paint job. The actual homestead is a conglomeration of
buildings added to each other as the principle use of the ranch changed
over the years. The crowning achievement of this piecemeal construction
project is the wide veranda that surrounds the entire place. This
glorified porch would be our home for five days.</p>
<p>The date was April 14, 1871 and Eliza Presho,fresh returned from a
week in the newly thriving port of Brisbane, decided to plant a small
creeping vine (the seeds of which were shipped in from London) at the
base of her wooden entrance arch at the Reedy Creek Ranch. Fast forward
136 years. This seemingly harmless plant, named Cat’s Claw, jumped to
the creek bottom and has spread 4 kilometers downstream. Cat’s Claw,
when properly maintained, remains small and produces lovely yellow
flowers, however, when released unchecked into a fragile environment it
turns into a monster. The vine engulfs entire trees choking off their
roots and leaves and ultimately killing them. As the trees falls into
the creek, the vine spreads downstream to the next victim. Our job would
be to cut the vines and spray the ends of them with Roundup. These
bastards grow up to an inch thick and a single tree can have fifty or so
vines surrounding it’s trunk. Added to this, once you cut the Cat’s
Claw, you have 15 seconds to spray the live end until the plant secrets
a clotting serum that protects it until it can regenerate. Oh the joys
of invasive species.</p>
<p>Armed with pruners and spray bottles, this proved to be very tough
work. The creek bed is very steep, though vacant at the time of water,
and temperatures hovered near 90 with nary a breath a wind. Around noon,
two rangers from the Taroom Station, Tasha and Nathanial, showed up.
This was quite the pair. Tasha was a wildly friendly woman who was never
at a loss for words. Nathanial, on the other hand, was a behemoth of a
man who barely uttered a sound. Having experience with Cat’s Claw, they
showed up with serrated, folding saws, which were an absolute godsend,
especially on the thicker, more entrenched vines.</p>
<p>We returned to the veranda around 3pm after a long day in the creek
bed. Any sort of progress was difficult to notice, as we had started our
Sisyphusian task at the absolute epicenter of the outbreak. Morale was
waning, but a delicious chili dinner helped to bring spirits up. Post
dinner, we played some cards; Jana teaching us a German version of
President/Asshole and Daniel introducing a British game him and his
mates called Shithead (a cross between Uno and Texas Hold ’Em) The sun
sets at 6:30. By the time the generator went out, we were all properly
knickered out and sleep was very welcome.</p>
<p><strong>What I Learned Today</strong>: <em>Exporting culture can be
like exporting invasive species, it may serve the exporter in the short
term (and in some aesthetic sense) but in the end, it usually kills the
entirety of the native culture (species) and needs to be removed. I feel
we are grossly in danger of infecting the entire world with our vacuous
materialistic culture. Through advertising and socio-political
indoctrination man’s desire for possession is overtaking all other
concerns; spiritual, environmental, and cultural alike. Gazing over a
Cat’s Claw infected forest is like peering deep into the soul of our
society…on the surface a pretty, green monoculture, but in reality, a
sick, destructive way of life.</em></p>
