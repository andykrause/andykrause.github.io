#### [Astoria: Astor and Jefferson's Lost Pacific Empire](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/astoria-peter-stark?variant=32122181812258):

&nbsp;

- By : Peter Stark

&nbsp;


Astoria, Oregon is a sleepy town near the mouth of the Columbia River known mostly for its horrible weather and as the backdrop for Goonies, the 1980s cult classic. Founded in the early 1800s, its ambitions were once much grander -- nothing less than to be the nexus of global trade in the Pacific and, possibly, the capital of a new democracy on the left coast of the continent.  Peter Stark’s Astoria captivatingly explores the driving forces behind this ambitious goal, the idiosyncrasies of the main players and, ultimately, the reasons for their failed enterprise. The short answer is greed. And an inability to grasp the vastness of the continent as well as the psychological toll of isolation and exposure on the human spirit. 

From our nationalist point of view the settlement of the American West is often told in three parts: 

1) Jefferson buys the better part of today’s central United States for a song from Napoleon, after which Lewis & Clark’s Corps of Discovery have a grand adventure finding the Pacific Ocean paving the way for:

2) The Oregon Trail which brought both settlers en masse as well a popular video game to the region which, eventually, led to; 

3) The California Gold Rush, the Railroads and the founding of wealthy cities all up and down the West Coast.  

Additionally, we are usually informed, that throughout these three acts the natives caused all manner of troubles, but in the end Manifest Destiny was too great of a force for the indigenous people. 

Of course this over-simplified treatment leaves out critical information about the who, the why, the where and the how of our nation’s march westward. In this book, Stark fills in key details about what happened after Lewis & Clark had returned home, but before there was an Oregon Territory.  

In those years after the Louisiana Purchase the nascent United States was intent on expansion, both territorially and economically (often one in the same). Though the revolution was over and freedom won, the country’s long term independence was not assured.  Lewis & Clark’s successful expedition spawned uncountable grandiose visions in the heads of East Coast Americans.  The fever reached the highest seats of power.  The country’s most powerful politician, Thomas Jefferson, and its richest businessman, John Jacob Astor, hatched a plan to settle the West Coast.  Jefferson, with the ambition of founding a sister democracy on the opposite coast to ensure the safety of the continent.  Astor, with the ambition of a global fur trade empire that could efficiently move product from the inland rivers of North America to the Chinese markets where furs fetched astronomical prices. Two parties were dispatched on the mission: return to the mouth of the Columbia and establish a trading post which would grow into a capitol city.  One by land and one by sea.  

Both reached their ultimate destination, though not on the aggressive time schedules envisioned. Nor were these journeys as comfortable and predictable as drawn up in a New York chamber room.  But, perhaps, the biggest mis-step by the backers of this endeavor was their utmost reliance on the un-wavering focus and commitment of the men involved.  Wars, weather and pure chance matter too, but any plan, like this one, that doesn’t leave enough contingency for simple human errors is bound to fail.  

Stark’s telling here is commendable. There is no hero worship, no misplaced nationalistic fervor or racial judgement. You root for some characters and against others, but only on their merits. You get his best researched facts in an approachable narrative. Sometimes, perhaps, too many of them, especially in the latter third of the book when geopolitics stir the already murky collection of events. 

There were two key takeaways for me. First, that it was Astor’s Overland Group that laid down most of what would become the Oregon Trail. By leaving the Missouri (for fear of the Blackfeet) they found a much easier set of passes leading to the Columbia Valley and, importantly, one that more readily handled covered wagons.  Second, the extent to which early trappers, adventurers and settlers relied on the native people to both wayfind and, often, simply survive. Without help from the Shoshone, Astor's men (and one woman) would have surely died in Hells Canyon. Similarly, a number of Great Plains tribes helped them around the Bighorn Mountains and out into the Snake River plain. The Ocean Group benefitted greatly from the Native Hawaiians as well. As interesting, or more so, as the white man's wanderings are the varied manner in which the numerous tribes conducted relations with the explorers and how, in many cases, those interactions were driven by the on-going inter-tribal conflicts.

Oh, and if you read this I dare you to find a bigger badass in all the world than Marie Dorian, the lone woman of the trip.  I won’t spoil the details here but her story — just a bit part of this expansive drama — is simply astounding.

#### [The Topeka School](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374277789)

&nbsp;

- By : Ben Lerner

&nbsp;

Come for the writing; stay for the story. Or maybe it is the other way around. You'll find the presentation is not simple, nor linear. It begins in a bricolage of perspectives and story lines, but stick it out, the plot will narrow and you'll be rewarded. Along the way you get Bob Dole, a Taipei brothel, crystal meth, Ivanka Trump, Westboro Church, those kids from your high school, that parent at the park, the patriachal underbelly of every small community, remorse, anger, forgiveness and a little bit of laughter. 

The author (also the protagonist) is a white male, my age; a fellow product of the mid- to late-1990s Middle American mono-culture. While our similarities end there, the shared vintage of our adolescence conjured a number of not-so-comfortable memories from my own past.  Peel away the personal history narratives -- the book is primarily written in the 'then' -- you find that this book is really about the 'now'.  It is a look at how language, its use, abuse and failure to master, are contributing to where we, America, find ourselves in 2020. Toxic masculinity is an principal theme, with information overload and abuse of privelege broached as well.

Lerner's high school debate history provides a core thread through the narrative. The stories are funny, the characters laughable, pitiable or hateable, often all three. From these anecdotes, however, arise two key concepts -- the 'spread' and the 'hyperbolic descent.'  The former is the author's term, and the more explored of the two. The latter is my own tagging of a manuever (theme), one somewhat orthagonal to the former.  

The 'spread' is a debate move whereby one rapidly presents as many points of argument as quickly as humanly possible. Your opponent has a higher burden on duty in terms of refutation and, therefore, in the name of time, can only address some of the original points.  The dropped or ignored points are considered as accepted and are scored as points for the first speaker.  Lerner hints that this same process is writ large in today's political world in which an abundance of rapid and successive lies and/or violations of laws, customs or norms cannot be properly refuted by your opponent and thus become either truth or are normalized. It is evident how effectively the current administration has utilized this technique to its own advantage.  More broadly, this is also true outside the political realm where the average citizen is overwhelmed daily by social media misinformation, scam artists, needy charities, global and local catastrophies (current or impending) and personal economic and health challenges. What gets dropped (ignored) is taken by its progenitor to be accepted or allowed.  

Where the 'spread' is wide and shallow, the hyperbolic descent is narrow and deep.  It works something like this.  Your opponent offers a new policy, say, for an extended food stamp program.  The response from hyperbolic descent is that such a program would create dependency on government, which leads to mass unemployment, which leads to the unraveling of society, which leads to decreased ability of America to defend itself internationally, which leads to nuclear war and the end of human civilization.  Every policy or argued point leads directly -- through a ridiculous linear progression -- to the end of civilization.  Higher gasoline taxes?  Causes nuclear war. Lowering the retirment age?  Nuclear war. Banning single use plastic bags?  Yep, nuclear war.  Mail-in voting?  You got it, nuclear war.  Every and anything your opponent offers is six steps or less from wiping out the entire human race.  Sound familiar?  You'll find it in most any public comment section of a online article, if you so dare to venture into the comments.

Lerner's reflections on language, its power and its abuse are wrapped into an intruiging, but not quite riveting, coming of age story. The three additional character view points exist to support the drama of the protagonist's, but each offer their own amusing and insightful contributions to the meta-themes of the book. Additionally,  with Klaus, a minor character, holocaust survivor and oddball mystic, Lerner channels his deepest critique of what some in our generation, our country have become. Klaus suggests that our crisis of privelege, of finding hate, depression and self-loating amidst utter abundance represents our desire for "adolescence without end."  For power and control and freedom without responsibility and commitment.  For a free lunch.

#### [The Deficit Myth](https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/stephanie-kelton/the-deficit-myth/9781541736184/)

&nbsp;

- By : Stephanie Kelton

&nbsp;

According to my Twitter feed, Stephanie Kelton’s The Deficit Myth would change the way that I thought about taxing and budgeting, about politics, about how our economy actually works.  Those are bold claims; lofty expectations.  The book delivered as promised.  

The thesis, simply put: If a county has monetary sovereignty then its spending is limited only by inflation and real resource constraints and not by deficits and debt. And, if that doesn’t spin your head quickly enough you’ll also discover that taxes don’t actually pay for spending at the Federal level.  This all sounds like pure insanity.  And in a way it is.  Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) — the larger academic endeavor for which this book stands as a user-friendly manual — offers such a radical and abrupt departure from what passes for accepted tenets in the macro-economic policy world that you’ll find it crazy that we’ve gone so long, wasted so much economic growth, and stunted so many productive lives under these false pretenses.   

To better understand the above we must, oddly enough, begin with Richard Nixon.  In 1971 Nixon canceled dollar-to-gold convertibility, a component of the original 1940s Bretton Woods agreement. The US dollar was now just paper.  Fiat, plain and simple.  Its value based on society’s acceptance of its worth in trade and nothing more. Interestingly enough, as Kelton lays out in this book, the free floating-ness of a fiat currency has a number of legitimate monetary and fiscal benefits. 

Having a fiat currency allows our government to pay off our debt whenever we want. Just print the money.  Actually, it is even easier than that.  Simply have the Fed buy back the Treasuries by digitally crediting the accounts of the bond holders.  Done.  No more national debt.  The risk, of course, is inflation.  Kelton spends the first half of the book meticulously guiding the reader through the logic of how a currency issuer (US government) can, and should, act differently from currency users (the rest of us).  For a currency issuer, spending is not bad.  In fact, it is the only way more money is ever added to an economy.  When the government spends too much (little) a deficit (surplus) results for the currency issuer but everyone else faces a surplus (deficit).  Surpluses in the non-federal government sector are good, that means all of us are getting wealthier, as a whole.  But again, this is only desirable so long as it doesn’t cause too much inflation.  The root of inflation is a situation where the group of currency users has more money then the real resources in the economy on which it can be spent.  In such a case, demand outstrips supply, prices get bid up and you get undesirable inflation.  The key here is the level of real resources — the products, services, jobs, natural resources, intellectual property, workers, etc.  Where there are idle resources, say mass unemployment and warehouses of things that the unemployed can’t buy, there is enough ‘slack’ in the economy to handle more spending without causing inflation.  Simply put, demand is too low to bid up prices.  This is when the currency issuer should spend.  Not doing so causes lost economic output, unmet potential and unnecessary human suffering.  Imagine the economy as a half-filled balloon.  A government deficit would put more air into the balloon, a surplus would take air out.  So long as we don’t overfill the balloon (inflation) we get a better result with a deficit than a surplus.  

The spending side is easily grasped.  What child hasn’t seen a video of a Treasury printing press and thought ‘why not just make more money?’.  MMT’s thinking around taxes, however, is considerably thornier to wrap your head around.  The belief that taxes pay for government services is a central tenet of both conservative and liberal ideologies.  For liberals it's the feel-good reason to send that check in knowing you are supporting a safety net for others; with conservatives this connection gives rise to the ‘no new taxes’ mantra, preferring to let private actors provide those social services.  As Kelton argues that at a Federal level this simply isn’t true.  We spend first, then tax later.  So why then do the Feds tax at all.   Instead of funding spending taxes encourage citizens to act in desirable ways (provide services, cease smoking, etc.), help control inflation and aid in balancing the distribution of economic resources thereby attempting to reign in the political power of the few. We spend to put money in and to direct economic growth, we tax to take money out (control inflation) and to direct citizen activities.  

There are three additional and important myths insidiously directing the action on Capital Hill.  First, that the interest we pay on our national debt is bad.  The reason we pay interest on the debt — by allowing holders of savings to buy treasuries — is to to support interest rates.  So long as those interest rates (which since 2009, we now directly set) are less than the growth rate of the economy, the interest on the debt is sustainable.  The second myth is that trade deficits are bad.  Another way of thinking about a trade deficit is a ‘stuff surplus’.  Its not a free lunch, however, as trade deficits can be bad if they are not covered by deficit spending and/or result in unemployment.  It should also be noted that our trade deficits with developing nations provide them with the dollars necessary to buy critical necessities, technology and medicine in the global market.  And, finally, there is the myth that many of our current entitlements — social security chief among them — are unsustainable.  As you may have guessed from the section on spending, we can always find the money to pay for an entitlement (especially an ‘earned’ one such as social security), what’s actually lacking is the stated and ratified guarantee to do so. In other words, the problem is political not fiscal.  Like all spending, we don’t need the taxes to cover it, only the ‘slack’ in the economy to spend without creating inflation.  

The myth-busting above exists, mostly, in a normative vacuum.  It explains the mechanism by which we can spend more but not necessarily on what we should be spending.  Kelton uses the final chapter of the book to lay out a plan, both on how MMT envisions handling the inflation risk while simultaneously building a better a better economy for all citizens.  Ideally, an economy would have an automatic pressure relief valve that would release (reduce spending) as we ran up against the real resource limits beyond we’d see undesirable inflation.  Kelton offer a federal job guarantee as a major component of this system.  In times of poor economic conditions, spending would automatically occur as un- and under-employment citizens fell back on guaranteed federal jobs.  This would stimulate spending and hasten the length of the downturn.  As the economy returned, the private sector would bid workers away from the federal jobs and spending would decrease.  A jobs guarantee program would obviate the need for many other forms of entitlement spending and would also create meaningful work products for the public.  It would also be a convenient approach to setting a functional minimum wage without directly legislating one.  

The takeaway: By recognizing the advantages of monetary sovereignty we can begin to address the deficits that actually matter:  a deficit of well-paying, meaningful jobs, a deficit of equal access to sufficient health care, a deficit of functioning public infrastructure, and a deficit of a sustainable relationship with the natural world. Kelton open our eyes to the fact that most of what lies between us and a better future is constrained by policy and politics and not by resources or money.

#### [War of Art](https://blackirishbooks.com/product/the-war-of-art/)

&nbsp;

- By : Steven Pressfield

&nbsp;

This is a self-help book. You may not like self-help books. Even so, you'll probably like this book. It is short, easy to read and no bullshit. Pressfield's thesis is this: self-generated resistance is what stands in the way of you becoming an artist, starting a business, losing weight, quitting smoking, showing political/emotional/social courage and/or loving. These un-lived lives of art, entrepreneurship, health, courage and love are what causes poverty, disease and un-happiness. His cure: do the work. Reject the immediate gratification in favor of the long term goal by doing the work. Cure your restlessness by doing the work. Show your contempt for failure by doing the work. Property, pampering and praise will not bring you joy; doing the work that you know you must will.

Pressfield lays out four dualities. In each, one side will help you defeat resistance, the other aids and abets this destructive force. We begin with the artist and the fundamentalist. The fundamentalist believes the truth has already been revealed and, as such, cannot envision a future.  With no horizon, fundamentalists are conquered, they retreat to the past and await the time for humanity to return to a prior, idealized state. The artist is centered on evolution, progress and self-mastery.  The truth is there to be found; the artist will make their life a liberating quest toward it. 

Next, the professional and the amateur. The amateur dabbles. The amateur is present in good times and gone in bad. The amateur makes big plans and fails to deliver. The amateur engages for pleasure.  Resistance crushes the amateur. The professional shows up, no matter what. Puts in the work, is realistic about deadlines and commitments and the realities of doing a thing right. The professional separates the important from the urgent. The professional is there for the work. Its OK to be an amateur, just not about things that matter. 

Third, the ego and the self. This was certainly the low point of the book for me. Pressfield's duality here strays a bit too supernatural to support the thesis. He knows it too, as this section is caveated as such and attempts to offer the reader multiple paths of interpretation. The central argument is that the ego is a self-concerned realist while the self is a altruistic dreamer.  The dreamer is, allegedly, better positioned to defeat resistance. Perhaps there is something in here...i didn't see it. 

Pressfield closes with the distinction between hierarchy and territory. An individual (human or animal) whose identity is rooted in hierarchy sees themselves as their rank in the societal order. Their actions, their happiness, their motivation and their self-worth is all determined by their place in the hierarchy.  Their rank is everything, and it generates a never-ending stream of resistance. The artist and the professional have no use for the hierarchy. They are concerned only with the territory, the domain, the field, the truth. For an artist or professional the territory provides all the needed motivation without external input. In fact, internally is the only way the territory can provide the drive to do the work. In a territory there are no short cuts, no cheating, no nepotism, no office politics. You simply must do the work and what you get out of it is directly proportional to what you put in.  

The efficacy of the advice in this book, of course, assumes the reader is in a position to exercise such freedom of action, of choice, over their life. It is written for an audience of, at the bare minimum, a measure of some privilege. The author admits as much. The advice here should not be dismissed because of it. Though 'art' is the primary examplar throughout the text, the tools here are just as successful in fighting the resistance that keep us from altruistic aims, principled stands, political courage, habit eradication and/or empathetic action. Anything that isn't easy, that isn't self-serving and immediately gratifying elicits resistance. The advise here helps identify and defeat it. So, do the work to defeat your resistance.

#### [Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World](https://davidepstein.com/the-range/): 

&nbsp;

- By : David Epstein

&nbsp;

The spoils of a graduate school education are myriad; a firm belief in the necessity of specialization chief among them. In this book, Epstein argues that our reliance on a deep and narrow pursuit of a solution is often misplaced. Our trust in and preference for the insight and opinions of siloed specialists is pervasive in our institutions, our relationships and often our own minds. But, there are situations -- many of them, in fact -- where greater specific knowledge leads to worse outcomes than broader and shallower understanding. It takes some un-learning to fully recognize and benefit from the power of generalized thinking.     

The key distinguising factor is the context of the problem and its formative learning environment.  Epstein marks these as either 'kind' or 'wicked'. Kind problems and learning environments have stable and exhaustable rule sets.  They are optimizable and easily simulated.  You won't be suprised to learn that in many of these cases, computers have caught and surpassed human ability.  These are also the environments where deep specialization pays the greatest dividends. Take chess.  Really, the only thing that helps with being a better chess player is more chess practice. Specialization is positively correlated with performance.  

The complement to kind problems are wicked ones. The rules here change frequently. So, too, do the inputs, the players and goals.  Optimization is generally not possible; most decisions or choices in a wicked problem require tradeoffs, unquantified and unquantifiable uncertainties, edge cases and exceptions, limited data and no chance for repetition. Here, specialization creates blinders; local minima from which escape is futile. Major life decisions, political policies, business ventures all originate in wicked learning environments...the things that shape our lives, our societies and our planet.   

Epstein's position is not that specialization and specialists are necessarily the problem, rather that they need to be mixed with breadth and generalists in order to for truly successful decisions and innovative work to result.  Key takeaways include:

* The importance of building teams with diverse backgrounds
* Encouraging or practicing periods of cross-polination of ideas and opinions
* Including creative expression, not just error correction, in your practice
* When teaching, trading procedural-based pedagogy for one centered on concepts

If the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence (to date) have taught us anything it is that computers and humans are good at vastly different things (a form of Moravec's Paradox). And, though the Age of the Renaissance (Wo)Man is firmly behind us, generalists are making a comeback due to their ability to tie together disparate threads of knowledge into unique and fascinating solutions for wicked problems. It just so turns out that hobbies, hunches and heuristics can offer promising leads where deep focus has failed us.

#### [American Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/306345/american-nations-by-colin-woodard/): 

&nbsp;

- By : Colin Woodard

&nbsp;

It is commonplace today to hear that we, as a nation, are more divided than ever.  Even in this Left Coast latte and laptop Liberal bubble, its hard to disagree with that sentiment.  American Nations provides both a structural theory of why, but also, perhaps, a refutation of our calls for contemporary exceptionalism in the matter of partisanship.  The central thesis is this: 

* Northern North America (basically everything north of Monterrey, Mexico) was founded by distinct nations and these nations still exist today, together with a handful of new nations that have developed over the past four hundred years.  Each nation has its own set of values and the political movements of (mostly) the US can be explained by the shifting coalitions between these nations over time. 

Being a history book, the thesis is supported by plenty of facts.  Woodard is a reporter, not an academic, so the story telling is solid, not amazing, but solid. This can be considered praise as there is only so much clean narrative you can weave through the tangled web of North American history. Certainly every PhD in US History has serious concerns about some aspect of this book, if for nothing else than it's Euro-Centric approach.  Woodard is very clear that he's taken such a lens because this book is ultimatly about the ebb and flow of regional ('national' in this sense) power dynamics and its an easier (and perhaps clearer) story to tell from the framework of the dominant culture. 

Allow me to attempt to distill the story into a moderately coherent and chronological synthesis. First came Spaniards up from Mexico to form El Norte.  But, because they were far from European commerce, the land arid, the peoples brown, their story must wait. Then came Tidewater (Jamestown).  Their hubris didn't survive the winter and they ate each other. Then a flood. Yankeedom arrived in the north with their Puritan values; second sons of English gentry to the Deep South with their aristocratic mien. Scotch-Irish rebels came too, but quickly scattered to the interior to avoid being told how to live (Yankeedom) or put to work (Deep South).  Tidewater recovered, bring better farmers and a more pragmatic aristocracy this time. Oh, and will the eastern seaboard of the US was being settled, New France was more or less peacefully existing (extracting natural resources) with the local indigenous populations.  A rough and tumble commercial hub -- a yang to the yin of the Holy city of Boston -- New Netherlands (New York) developed its own Hanseatic ambitions.  German farmers found a swath of land from Philadelphia due west to be both familiar in climate and soil and far enough from the virtues of Yankeedom and the vices of the Deep South to existing largely in peace as the Midlands nation.  

Much of the first few centuries of American political history represent a struggle between Yankeedom and the Deep South to pull the Midlands, Tidewater and, occasionally, New Netherlands into their coalition.  The Civil War was more of the same.  Contemporaneously, the Left Coast and Far West were being developed.  Neither a full clone of an existing nation, the Left Coast evolved most from Yankeedom stock, and the Far West from Appalachia.  The world wars and the end of American expansion (save Hawaii and Alaska) brought a tenuous truce as the federation (the US) turned to its external enemies. Post WWII social changes again pushed the nations apart: free love, drugs, the environmental movement, civil rights.  The church stepped in to provide a rallying cry for the Deep South, Appalachia and Tidewater; collectively the Dixie Block.  The religion of the free market pushed the Far West (perhaps the biggest receipt of government investment) away from Northern Alliance (Yankeedom, Left Coast and New Netherlands) communal beliefs, while rich Left Coasters doubled down on 'liberal' social and economic policy.  

In sum, Woodard argues that the divide between the Dixie Block and Northern Alliance remains the defining conflict in our society today. Further, he insists that what will hold it together, and what has always held it together, is a functioning and practical central government -- a necessity that looks less present with every passing week. All told, it is a compelling argument, well presented. I'd add that there has evolved a second dimension: urban vs rural.  I think this is especially so for rural areas in borderland zones that are not within the core of a nation and for dense urban areas the country around.  

Even if you don't buy the relatively concise and simplistic theory of Woodard's, you'll pick up concerning revalations about your favourite historical American, a deeper distrust of people's motives and greater appreciation for how tenuous the path from 13 English Colonies starving through a long winter to global superpower struggling with self-goverance really was as well as the challenges that lie ahead.

#### [Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17986418-naked-statistics): 

&nbsp;

- By : Charles Wheelan

&nbsp;

About 50 pages into this book I thought to myself; ‘they should teach this in high school’; the ‘this' being the general statistical literacy which the book is about. Very shortly thereafter the prescriptiveness and condescension of that statement hit me and and I thought better of sharing it openly with anyone. Also, it made me realize I’m old.  My personal feelings aside, Whelan's clarity of presentation and methodical march through the basics of applied statistics is broadly approachable.  And funny, to boot.  The standard examples like the Monty Hall problem and laughable reverse causality situations all make an appearance.  And so do new ones, like the Schlitz Beer's taste test ploy in the 1980s, which,  though commendable, couldn't save the brand.  

All humor and Stats 101 aside, there is deeper layer, a line of argument that should resonate with data and analytics professionals.  It is that incorrect, misleading and malfeasant uses of statistics are not the fault of the math itself, but rather the application.  In short, no amount of sophisticated modeling and analysis can overcome bad data, biased sampling, poor choices of variables and a faulty research design.  More conceptually and, perhaps, normatively, Whelan argues that our thinking about how to use data has lagged seriously behind our ability to gather and analyze it.  Put another way, we can put a lot of effort into building very precise models — getting the data, sampling and variables correct — only to find out later that they are not very ‘accurate’ in the sense of solving the problem we originally intended to.  

Whelan equates data to offensive lineman. As such, they are a necessary but not sufficient condition for creating an accurate, useful and honest statistical analysis.   Machine learning as a discipline seems to be coming around to this view as well.  Modeling improvements still matter, but rarely will they improve performance to same level as greatly increasing the size of the data.  Amidst the continuous improvements in computing power, deep learning and AI in general, it can be easy to forget the importance of asking the right question and collecting the right data. This book is an enjoyable read that provides a gentle reminder of why we do analyses in the first place and how to ensure that the fundamentals — the lineman — are both efficiently operating and dutifully respected.

#### [How To: Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real World Problems](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/576760/how-to-by-randall-munroe/): 

&nbsp;

- By : Randall Munroe

&nbsp;

A decade ago, around a campfire, after many beers, we pondered the horizontal pressure of an above ground swimming pool. How much force does the water exert and was it greater for a large but shallow pool or a tall, but small (in circumference) one? Related, is it more difficult to displace water in a small versus a large pool?  While we did not answer those questions that night, we did successfully melt an aluminium can and boil water in a paper cup.  If you’ve ever wondered these type of wonders or experimented these type of experiments then this is your kind of book (the pool question is covered, btw).  Basically a ‘deeply-researched and somewhat obscene answers to questions you are usually too sober or too embarrassed to ask’ book.   

Munroe is the author of the XKCD comic strip; well known in some circles, likely unheard of in most.  Here he presents legit science wrapped up in similar dry humor.  There are equations, but if you skip them you won’t miss anything.  There are also drawings, which shouldn’t be passed over.  The formula is: 1) Insert somewhat innocuous question about how to do a standard human thing; 2) Take said question to the extreme; and 3) Supported extreme answer with math and jokes.  And it works.  Rare is the book that can handle Kant and Evil Knievel in successive chapters.  

What else is covered?  Popular Culture: Is the dig at Oak Island worth it?; Popular Wisdom: Is ‘red at night’ really a delight?; and Popular Mechanics: How to best disable a flying drone?  If you still aren’t convinced, you’ll learn how far you can actually throw a given object…and for that alone you should crack the cover.

Online reviews of this book range from “Dude, totally best book ever” to “This book is a poorly done 'Buddhism for Bros'”.  I fall somewhere in the middle.  It contains useful wisdom, wrapped, occasionally a bit overly so, in modern context and lexicon.  The title — clearly a marketing win — sets the expectations of readers; which depending on how far down the self-help (or Psychology PhD) path one has trod could be a positive or negative push.  

I took the following from this book, presented in what I gathered was the author's line of reasoning:

* Stop worrying about unimportant things (giving a fuck).  We all have a limited set of things we can care about, make yours count because:
* Everyone has problems. The goal of life should be to have good problems. ‘Good’ in the sense that you enjoy working on their solutions because:
* Human happiness stems not from having money/fame/power but from solving problems.  To the extent that these things can help you solve good problems they are means, but not the end.  *But I don’t choose my own problems...Wait, do I?* 
* Our values define our success metrics which in turn help determine which problems we encounter and are working (or maybe not) to overcome. Thus, set good values and good problems will result. *Ok, so what is a ‘good' value?*
* Good values have two features: 1) They are internally operable; they do not require external acceptance; and 2) They are process-oriented, not result-oriented (such values often violate #1). *Can I tell which of the values that meet these criteria I should pursue?* 
* What determines your success at fulfilling your values and solving their associated problems is whether or not you are willing to endure (enjoy) the suffering (work) it takes to express that value.  Essentially, you need to envision what work it would take to achieve this value (to solve the problems associated with that value) and ask yourself very honestly if you enjoy the process, the practice, the suffering, the work — all of the negative aspects -- that it would take to reach this goal.  If not, you won’t be successful. 
* In short: Stop chasing positive rewards, critically assess your values, learn to enjoy the negative (work) associated with solving problems and quit worrying about unimportant shit along the way. 

This is all, of course, aimed at well-to-do, existentially-confused young westerners whose problems do not include access to clean water, malaria, famine, war, despotism and other life threatening circumstances.  It is a quick read and, for those of us lucky enough to have some say in what we ‘give a fuck about’, a worthwhile reminder of the importance of setting the right values and in putting in the work necessary to nurture, express and live those values.

#### [Prisoners of Geography](https://www.audible.com/pd/Prisoners-of-Geography-Audiobook/B01MFBS0ZZ): 

&nbsp;

- By Tim Marshall

&nbsp;

Don’t let the title fool you, this is as much or more of a history book than a geography book.  While the book is organized into chapters based on ’10 maps that explain the world’, with a few exceptions, there is almost a complete lack of interesting or useful maps to help the narrative.  The ’10 maps’ are simply ten countries/regions of focus — each presented with a very standard political geography map.  I spent no small amount of time referencing Google Maps during my reading and feel a sizable contribution of this book could have been in clearly locating (mapping) the forces driving each country's decisions, both past and present.  

The tagline here should be ‘selected geopolitics of the 20th and early 21st century’.  With that aim in mind, it is a successful book: approachable, yet detailed.  An undergraduate modern world history seminar could do well by assigning this as a supplemental reader.  A few notable themes that emerge: 1) The disastrous consequences of colonial powers drawing borders without regard for historical settlement patterns; 2) The extractive development of the Southern Hemisphere leading to large coastal capitals and underdeveloped hinterlands; and 3) The continued importance of proximity in diplomacy (Moscow is near, Washington is far).  

Many of the (assumed) political motivations are discussed under the umbrella of energy politics.  Either I’m naive about the supremacy of energy in driving (geo)politics or this book takes an overly simplistic view.  Truthfully, a mass market non-fiction book probably cannot do justice to the full suite of considerations; nonetheless, Marshall leaves the reader feeling as if the sole determinant of a state’s actions are oil and natural gas.  Barring the final chapter on the Arctic, climate and ecological issues are given short shrift. Technological capital and labor markets are thinly discussed as well.  Again, perhaps state machinations really are primarily driven by the quest for hydrocarbons…and if so, it would explain the world’s reluctance to address climate change and support alternative energy solutions.  

All in, it is a quick and worthwhile read.  Many factoids and smaller points of information may surprise — ex. the British traded their overseas bases to the Americans for warships in 1940 — while the general themes are broad and, somewhat evident.  I was left with a sense of foreboding; a collision between the US and China in the Pacific seems imminent as does Russia’s dominance of the Arctic.  Geography may end up being a cruel jailor.
