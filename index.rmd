I lead new research and development for Zillowâ€™s [Zestimate](https://www.zillow.com/how-much-is-my-home-worth/) and related home valuation products.  Prior to Zillow I taught research methods and data science to real estate students at the University of Melbourne and worked as a data scientist developing Automated Valuation Models (AVMs) for Greenfield Advisors, a valuation consulting firm.   My doctoral degree is in Urban Planning from the University of Washington and I try to remain active in academic conferences and publications.  My primary research and professional aim is to straddle the academic and applied sides of the valuation industry.  When not writing R code or staring at plots, I can be found hiking, biking and paddling with my family in the Pacific Northwest.
