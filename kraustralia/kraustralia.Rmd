  <h3>Let's Go Anywhere </h3> <br/>
  <i>16 January 2015 </i> <br/>
     Seattle, WA <br/>
   <br/>

   We are setting off to start our our new life in Melbourne, Australia. With us on this adventure is as little as we could imagine bringing to a new home halfway around the world, . Two bags for each of us to last until our half container pod of remaining essentials (and some not so) are set to arrive 4-6 weeks after we do. 

  We bid adieu to Alley 24, our home for <a href="https://www.andykrause.com/kraustralia/kraustralia_full.html#kraustralia_0">... (click for more)</a>.

<h3>Arrival in Melbourne </h3> <br/>
<i>22 January 2015 </i> <br/>
Melbourne, Vic <br/>
<br/>
A full twenty-four hours after leaving Seattle -- via our scheduled Los Angeles stop and our unscheduled Sydney one -- we arrived in Melbourne. Immigration and customs took a matter of minutes, either a nod to Australian efficiency or, possibly, apathy. Our journey to the taxi stand took us outside and into the heat, a very welcome 36C (97F) heat. As our cab headed into the city our fatigue and exhaustion melted away as our new home came into view out of the car <a href="https://www.andykrause.com/kraustralia/kraustralia_full.html#kraustralia_1">...

<h3>Settling In </h3> <br/>
<i>23 January 2015 </i> <br/>
Melbourne, Vic <br/>
<br/>

On our first full day, we dove right into the culture with a cup of morning tea out on our deck.  The cool, marine breeze of the early morning soon gave way to summer heat. We took a long walk along the Bay Trail down to Point Ormond.  The way back was warm; the heat, the sweat, the sun on our skin all so wonderful after the last few months in wet and cool Pacific Northwest. We live here now.

For three weeks in late January / early February all eyes -- in the tennis world at least -- are on Melbourne and the Australian Open.  Or, more affectionately referred to here on the ground as <em> The Tennis </em>. The cultural immersion program we had set for ourselves dictate that we attend, and that we did.  A gorgeous, sunny Saturday with temperatures near 30C (86F), we arrived early, as did the rest of <a href="https://www.andykrause.com/kraustralia/kraustralia_full.html#kraustralia_3">...

The Queen Victoria Market is both a tourist trap full of fake Australian Outback hats and crocodile wallets as well as fully functional grocery store and mercantile. Where else can you buy a pallet of kangaroo pelts, mystery crystals, footie gear, toothpaste, antique collectibles and a dozen duck eggs all in the same place.  There is truly something for everyone.  We bought none of the above, <a href="https://www.andykrause.com/kraustralia/kraustralia_full.html#kraustralia_4">... (click for more)</a>.

Melbourne, Vic <br/>
<br/>

Australia Day celebrates the 1788 landing of the British First Fleet in the Sydney Cove. We expected something like an Australian Fourth of July extravaganza. On account of souring public opinion over the ensuing treatment of the Aboriginal peoples, the reality of the holiday is something closer to a modest Columbus Day barbecue.

When not outside basking in the glorious January weather, we are busy on [Domain.com.au](https://www.domain.com.au/) searching for a place to live. This either means walking or taking the trams/trains to different neighborhoods around the city until we are exhausted or sunburned, often both. Our standard operating procedure once in such a condition is to find refuge and relief in a gelato or frozen yogurt shop.

We are still vagabonds, living off of takeout at our small, but comfortable AirBnB in the heart of St. Kilda. We put in an application for the small brick homes in the photo below.  There are no guarantees here in this 'lottery for a rental home' system. It is just one of hundreds that we’ve looked at online and one of a handful that we’ve inspected and applied for.

After many tours, followup emails and countless hours scouring online listings, we finally secured a place to live.  It is a wee Victorian cottage in a neighborhood called Albert Park. It is a quaint, but upscale little area with adequate, but not hip, amenities and, importantly, is only a walk or short bike ride to the beach and a direct tram ride away from <a href="https://www.andykrause.com/kraustralia/kraustralia_full.html#kraustralia_10">...

In need of a vacuum, a year’s worth of toilet paper, three liters of barbecue sauce, a kilo and half of haloumi and several other bulk items that can only be moved with a pallet jack, we took a short tram ride to Costco Australia, conveniently located just north of downtown Melbourne.

Big week for us.

After tethering our cell phones to our computers in order to get work done and sitting on the floor for 2 weeks, this was a big improvement.

We are getting to know our new city bit by bit and day by day.

Whilst wandering the city, one of the most pleasant surprises is volume and diversity of street art in Melbourne.

For Erin's upcoming birthday we decided to finally leave the comforts of the big city and venture into rural Victoria -- the Mornington Peninsula to be precise.  To do so meant renting a car and driving. Not just any driving, but driving on the left hand side of the road...or basically unlearning everything that you've been consciously (and sometimes not so) doing for the past <a href="https://www.andykrause.com/kraustralia/kraustralia_full.html#kraustralia_19">...

As the first people through the door, hustled up the hill to stake our claim in the aptly named Hilltop pool.

<h3>Grampians National Park</h3> <br/>
<i>6-7 April 2015 </i> <br/>
Halls Gap, Vic <br/>
<br/>
 
Toward our effort to explore our new state of Victoria, we took a quick two-day trip out for some bushwalking in the [Grampians National Park](https://www.visitgrampians.com.au/discover-the-region). The Grampians Mountain Range, or Gariwerd as known to the local Aboriginals, is a photogenic sandstone range that runs north-south cutting through the Victorian plains. <a href="https://www.andykrause.com/kraustralia/kraustralia_full.html#kraustralia_23">...

Melbourne, Vic <br/>
<br/>
 
Fall is definitely here, as the non-indigenous, deciduous trees are all beginning to drop their leaves.  After a lifetime in the Northern Hemisphere, it is really hard to condition yourself to think of April as being fall. We've both continually been referring to the upcoming months as 'summer', though they'll be anything but as our local friends are keen to remind us.  People here have assured us <a href="https://www.andykrause.com/kraustralia/kraustralia_full.html#kraustralia_24">... (click for more)</a>.

Ballarat, Vic <br/>
<br/>
 
This weekend we were invited out to visit our friends Brooke and Steve who are ‘farmsitting’ for a month out in the country. The farm is just outside of the town of Ballarat and although it seemed a world away from the city, it only took about an hour’s drive when we left midday Friday. After an afternoon tour of the farm, we drove into Ballarat to stock up on groceries and drinks.  Prior to the first gold strike, Ballarat was <a href="https://www.andykrause.com/kraustralia/kraustralia_full.html#kraustralia_25">... (click for more)</a>.

Melbourne, Vic <br/>
<br/>
 
Our well-laid plans to hike in the mountains east of the city were dashed due to storms. We pivoted and instead embarked on an urban hike to try to get to know our city a little better.  Andy kept on calling this a ‘Day of Culture’ but since I am writing this blog post, I will note that a ‘Day of walking really far’ would have been just as apt.  From our home in Albert Park, we trekked first to the National Gallery of <a href="https://www.andykrause.com/kraustralia/kraustralia_full.html#kraustralia_26">... (click for more)</a>.

<br/>
 
As an early birthday present, Erin planned a short trip for us to Noosa and the Sunshine Coast -- a set of beachfront communities about an hour north of Brisbane.  We caught a Thursday afternoon flight out of Melbourne, which was quite bumpy due to the developing thunderstorms along coast.  As we approached the landing, our pilots hit the gas and pulled out of it a few moments before impact and then circled <a href="https://www.andykrause.com/kraustralia/kraustralia_full.html#kraustralia_27">...

We left our Alexandra Heads accommodation early on the slow bus bound for Noosa.  The trip -- cheap and comfortable -- follows the windy road all up the coast.  We stopped every ½ mile or so to pick up a barefooted surfer or two along the way.  Scenic, slow and crowded by the time we arrived in downtown Noosa.

After five months at sea – well more like two months at sea and three months in customs and port storage facilities – our shipment of household goods finally arrived.  And just 72 hours prior to our flights back to the U.S. for the month of June.  The boxes looked like they had been kicked, dragged and thrown the entire 8,186 miles, but miraculously nothing, minus <a href="https://www.andykrause.com/kraustralia/kraustralia_full.html#kraustralia_29">...

<h3>Winter in Melbourne</h3> <br/>

[Andy] I returned from our hectic U.S. trip to depths of Melbourne winter. A calm and sunny 55 degrees.  As a native of the upper Midwest I remember late spring/early summer days that weren’t this nice. Yet, a good portion of the locals took the opportunity to don their North Face puffy jackets and knit, woolen hats.  Perhaps overkill, but I do love the smell of the wood fireplaces burning in our <a href="https://www.andykrause.com/kraustralia/kraustralia_full.html#kraustralia_30">... (click for more)</a>.

[Erin] I flew back to Melbourne on July 8th, prepared to keep myself busy with work until Andy got back on the 26th. One Cryptolock Virus, one trans-Pacific voyage for my computer and one panic attack later I found myself without a laptop, feeling completely un-tethered from society.

[Erin] Earlier this week, on a day that promised to have 0% chance of rain, I took a bike ride out of town to visit the Heide Museum of Modern Art. A 20 kilometer bike ride from the city, the Heide sits within 15 acres of parklands.  The land was purchased by John and Sunday Reed in 1934.

One perk of moving to a large, international city is that many of our friends, family and colleagues have connections here in Melbourne.  As a result, from time to time we get set up for, what could only be called, blind dates.  This Sunday was such an occasion.

We each had a busy past week preparing for new adventures; Andy with baseball tryouts for the Port Melbourne Mariners, (serendipitously enough our local team), and me with my first teaching experience at the University.

Eric arrived today, our first visitor from back home. For his first full day, we hit up the South Melbourne Market for a lunch of Yum Cha (Dim Sum), Oysters and Meat Pies.  We then took a long, leisurely stroll into downtown, winding through Melbourne’s famous alleyways, eventually grabbing a few beers from a small café. There were many choices of alleyway bars, but we were lured in by the large Italian man who smelled strongly of coconut and vanilla and who offered us <a href="https://www.andykrause.com/kraustralia/kraustralia_full.html#kraustralia_35">...

The offer of a free upgrade at the rental car office is always a good omen for a road trip. The ‘upgrade’, in this case, meant getting handed the keys to metallic green Holden Commodore Sport Edition.  If you are anything other than an Aussie or absolute car wonk, you probably have never heard of Holden.  It is an oft-maligned domestic brand.  Think Pontiac not Cadillac.

[Erin] We began day 2 of our Great Ocean Road trip in search of more koalas. Slow and seemingly high, these marsupials are 70% shanks, 20% ears and 100% adorable.  My maths don't add up, but the description should at least give you an overall understanding of the koala bear cuteness. We understood the 'bear' descriptor after seeing these little guys in action (or inaction), but I would probably characterize them as part Ewok, part hamster. <a href="https://www.andykrause.com/kraustralia/kraustralia_full.html#kraustralia_37">...

Horse racing in Victoria still maintains a measure of cultural and social importance.  Or, in other words, still offers members of polite society a chance to dress up and remind themselves that they are still members of polite society. The horses themselves are a bit of an afterthought.
