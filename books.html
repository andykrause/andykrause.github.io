<div id="comfort-crisis" class="section level4">
<h4><a href="https://eastermichael.com/book/">Comfort Crisis</a></h4>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>By : Michael Easter</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>To have an easy life, do hard things. That is it. That’s the tweet.
That’s this book in eight words. By the transitive power of credos, the
converse is also true in that making the consistent and conscious choice
to do only easy things is a great way to make your life hard.</p>
<p>Psychologically, the above has been shown to be true because our
minds are lazy; though in a well-meaning way. To conserve energy and
storage we default to using relative comparison not absolute grading to
rank prior experiences and make judgements about our potential
investment into future endeavors. Our expectations and, thereby, the
grading scale of our own experiences are a rolling average of what we’ve
done and experienced over time, weighted to the recent past. The result:
we gain less and less (dis) satisfaction from the same (dis) comfort
over time. Put another way, it takes us greater (dis) comfort to
maintain our same level of (dis) satisfaction over time. The infamous
hedonic treadmill. So, if you want something hard to seem easy and if
you want to find joy or, at the very least, not find annoyance, at small
discomforts make sure that you have done something even harder, even
more annoying, of even greater discomfort in the past to compare it
to.</p>
<p>From this growing understanding of the mechanisms that drive our
human behavior, some of the more ambitious of us have, naturally, gone
to the extreme to test its efficacy. Enter the Misogi. A purposeful
undertaking of a radically difficult task with the sole purpose of
raising your grading scale of what represents discomfort. A Misogi has
two rules: 1) You don’t talk about Misogi (no social media) and 2) Don’t
die. This book plays out in and through the author’s own Misogi, a
month-long caribou hunting trip in northern Alaska. The Misogi is a
useful framework for the ideas within and not its central message. In
other words, this book is not some narrow call to libertarian
crypto-bros to spend more time doing death defying stunts. Instead, it
is a well-executed academic and experiential discussion of our
psychological relationship to (dis) comfort and how this relationship
influences our ability to change.</p>
<p>To summarize, Easter suggests we do more of the following: be bored,
be hungry, be cold, be outside, be thinking about death, be dirty, be
open to new situations…in short, be uncomfortable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why be bored? Micro-discomforts like having to wait in a grocery
line without pulling out your phone force your mind to think, leading to
greater creativity and reduction in dopamine addiction to
information.</li>
<li>Why be hungry? Aside from physiological benefits of fasting, here
too, learning to embrace a little bit of hunger and deal with it can
help break our tendencies to use eating as an antidote to stress and
boredom.<br />
</li>
<li>Why be cold? Uncomfortable temperatures can improve the body’s
self-regulation and expand our zone of acceptable temperatures.<br />
</li>
<li>Why be outside? Just being in nature can reduce stress and other
negative physiological risk factors.</li>
<li>Why be thinking about death? It helps you prioritize what is truly
important in life.</li>
<li>Why be dirty? Higher levels of good bacteria on your skin can
improve gut and skin health. Too much antibiotic use can harm these same
systems.</li>
<li>Why be open to new situations? ‘Flow’ states whereby we are often
maximally creative/effective and joyous rarely, if ever, happen during
routine tasks. When you are engaged in a new activity you have to focus,
it kills brain clutter.</li>
</ul>
<p>It could be easy to confuse this book as a collection of life hacks,
just one big compilation of ‘one easy trick to do X’ click-baity
suggestions. I think it is actually the polar opposite. Recognizing that
discomfort is the route to positive change undermines the whole ‘life
hack’ mentality by which doing something easy results in something
worthwhile. Instead, as the author puts it elegantly, you have to ask
yourself:</p>
<p>‘What are you mentally and spiritually willing to put yourself
through to be a better human?’</p>
<p>You have to do the work to truly appreciate the result; you have to
be uncomfortable to truly appreciate comfort.</p>

<h4><a
href="https://www.abebooks.com/9781552853511/Curve-Time-Blanchet-M-Wylie-1552853519/plp">The
Curve of Time</a></h4>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>By : M. Wylie Blanchett</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>To me, an adventurer conjured visions of travel; wild, far-ranging,
occasionally dangerous and often spontaneous travel. Almost certainly
travel for the sake of new experiences. Capi Blanchett’s classic The
Curve of Time vastly expanded my conception of what an adventurer is and
can be. I’ll admit that as a parent I should never have had such a
narrow definition, such a preconceived notion of what that term meant.
Blanchett’s work shows that an adventurer can also travel – with all the
above adjectives – for the purpose of teaching resilience, testing her
capacity for patience and calm and sharing her deep appreciation for
nature, solitude and exploration with others.</p>
<p>For Blanchett, adventure was taking her five young children out into
the British Columbia coast each summer for months at a time in a small
boat. Widowed by an accident on the very same boat, she turned the
tragic vehicle into the centerpiece of their family. Being the late
1920s and early 1930s, it was very likely she was the only woman
captaining a boat in the Strait of Georgia and certainly the only one
doing it with herself and five kids sharing a sleeping area of 128
square feet. Beside the Herculean effort of just parenting such a brood
on a boat, they had amazing, traditional adventures as well: climbing
mountains, delivering postal messages, running rapids, breaking bones,
tracing the paths of de Fuca and Vancouver, dodging bears and cougars
and general marine challenges like avoiding summer storms and fixing
broken parts. Occurring over many summers, any one of these trips would
be a child’s greatest memory; the collection of them is testament both
to the will of Blanchett herself but also the malleability of children
to fit their environment. These adventures no doubt shaped the lives of
the Blanchett children.</p>
<p>Blanchett is a good writer, but the prose is not memorable. Their
trials and tribulations are evident, but on their own not particularly
noteworthy. There were no flashy accomplishments to speak of, no first
summits or transits or circumnavigations. No, it is the fortitude and
the grit that are truly impressive. The days spent waiting out a storm
in a tiny space with five small, wiggly bodies. The weeks on end of
eating fish and dried goods. The maintenance of inter-sibling
relationships, hygiene and overall health while charting a small vessel
through some precarious water in a world inhabited, then, mainly by
indigenous communities, fur trappers, miners and logging parties. The
will to go on, to do this every summer and to thrive while doing it.</p>
<p>I shall, forever more, feel shame for losing my patience with the
kids on a four-hour flight or for dreading the rainy afternoon trapped
in the house with walls that seem to be closing in. I shall also seek to
use the travel that we do undertake – travel not usually as
‘adventurous’ as Blanchett’s – as an opportunity to teach (and practice,
myself) resilience, patience, calm and appreciation.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.timdenevi.com/freak-kingdom">Freak Kingdom:
Hunter S. Thompson’s Manic Ten-Year Crusade Against American
Fascism</a></h4>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>By : Timothy Denevi</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>I spent much of my twenties reading, and often re-reading, Hunter
Thompson’s work. My experience of him had always been through his
writing; a view from his own eyes; through the Gonzo lens. Freak
Kingdom, by Timothy Denevi, was my initial second hand taste of the
madness that was Thompson. Denevi’s style does not match HST himself,
few could, but it does an admirable job of separating the man from the
myth and, of course, channeling the fear and the loathing of that age.
And, while only a decade of Thompson’s career are chronicled here, the
trajectory is clearly set and the eventual end should come as no
surprise to even those unfamiliar with the Thompson’s story.</p>
<p>At its heart, this is a story about a man’s search to understand his
country at a time when the country itself was struggling with the same
question. We find ourselves and our country in a not dissimilar position
today. There are chilling parallels in this the book, for sure, despite
the chasm of technological, political and societal differences between
this age and that one. This book and this decade of Thompson’s life is
also a story about drugs and politics and media and publishing and
indecency and power. And what happens when you mix them all in a soup
bowl the size of the U.S. and feed it to a tenacious, addiction-prone,
self-style freak.</p>
<p>This formative period in Thompson’s life begins in, what was then,
humble Woody Creek, Colorado. Before Aspen became Aspen and Woody Creek
home to 8-figure compounds with private landing strips masquerading as
working ranches. Woody Creek; 1963: As the world stood still surrounding
the assassination of JFK, Thompson saw the writing on the wall – the
rise of LBJ – and a preternatural instinct to oppose ‘fascism’ and
related tendencies kicked in, spurring him and his young family to
uproot to California to be closer to the action. They landed in Sonoma,
and while not finding it the center of the universe as Hunter had hoped,
it changed his life forever; namely through his new found addition to
Dexetrone. Not long after, the sheer magnetism of San Francisco in the
1960s pulled them south into the city…where he would find
action-a-plenty.</p>
<p>From here the pace quickens, the story begins to unfold. Thompson’s
coverage of Goldwater’s nomination at the ’64 GOP convention confirms
his belief that fascism is alive, well and threatening on our shores.
Despite the action, his personal economic outlook remains bleak. To land
a big story (and related paycheck) he falls in the with the Hells
Angels. He meets and parties with Ken Kesey. He buys a motorcycle and
goes on near suicidal rides. His pharmacological proclivities develop
further, while his domestic life begins to unravel. For a hot moment, he
empathizes with the Angels and how their pursuit of the American Dream
is no different than that of the common man – both cast aside by our
false meritocracy, our nepotism and 20th century serfdom by another
name; in short the system. Thompson’s empathy and and understanding;
however, is swiftly discarded as he witnesses the Angels attack an
anti-war protest in Oakland. They, too, had become just another boot of
the man, a group wielding violence for its own sake or, worse, that of
some elite in an expensive suit and shined shoes.</p>
<p>The Hells Angels piece becomes a book, a successful one at that, and
launches Thompson to national fame, at least in journalistic circles.
The embedded reporter who is part observer, part participant, a true
Gonzo journalist for whom no length is too far and no rule too sacred to
break in the name of telling the story right. As such, the book was
brutally honest about the Angels and their shortcomings and, expectedly,
earned him a beating later in life for it. This ends his first affair
with San Francisco and with a bankroll he moves back to Woody Creek to
set his life back in order.</p>
<p>Enter Oscar Zeta Acosta. The ‘Brown Buffalo’. In Thompson’s own
words: ‘God’s own prototype…too weird to live and too rare to die’.
Acosta’s time with Thompson is short lived, here, at first as he quickly
return to Los Angeles to continue his fight for Latino rights. Hunter
heads to the opposite coast to begin covering the 1968 presidential
election. The lead up to this election is electric. In a short year, RFK
and MLK are killed, meanwhile LBJ decides not to run, setting the field
wide open. Thompson ends up covering both parties in the primaries. As
is his custom, he finds his way front and center to the action; first in
back of limousine with Nixon talking pro football, then pinned against
the glass of a Chicago hotel, his motorcycle helmet the only thing
keeping him from a concussion at the hands of the CPD. His Chicago
experience – the crushing brutality of the police at the Democratic
Convention – would stay with him forever and with it, his hatred of
Daley and Humphrey and establishment Democrats who shared tactics with
the likes of Richard Milhous Nixon. ’68 would end poorly for Thompson:
Nixon wins easily and Sandy has another unsuccessful attempt at a child,
but it would also launch his own attempt at a political career.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;Reader’s Insert&gt;&gt; As someone born in the 80s and
educated in a small town Midwestern public school system most of my
historical knowledge about the sixties began and ended with Vietnam and
Flower Power. While I knew about MLK, RFK and some of the high drama of
the age, I was utterly shocked at the absolute shit storm, dumpster
fire, ‘may you live in interesting times-ness’ of 1968. Foremost, the
DNC convention, Nixon’s treason in Saigon, and the latino civil rights
movement in LA and violence it brought. For many of my generation we
confidently feel that that January 6th insurrection and ensuing melee
were the apex of political crimes in this country…I now realize that is
not the case.</p>
<p>Stung by Nixon’s victory over the hapless Humphrey, Thompson
retreated to Woody Creak in order to affect change locally. He nearly
won the local sheriff’s race on the Freak Power ticket – attracting some
dangerous attention from shady figures along the way. Following his
loss, he turned away from politics for a few years. A few years that
would produce two of his most famous works. First, his piece on the
Kentucky Derby with illustrator Ralph Steadman. Til that time, no one
had fully chronicled the carnal debauchery and outright drunkenness of
the Derby. It was an assignment hand crafted for Hunter, one at which he
flourished. A bit later, while in LA covering the Ruben Salazar case, he
and Acosto took a seat-of-the-pants trip to Las Vegas to ‘get the hell
out of LA for a weekend’ and to cover the Mint 500 race. A few weeks
later they would return for the national District Attorney’s convention
on controlled substances. Together, these two trips would form the
material for Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The book would strain his
relationship with Acosta terminally but would further cement HST’s
journalistic stardom.</p>
<p>With the 1972 election approaching, Rolling Stone would convince
Thompson to give another year of his life to the circus of American
presidential campaigns. And a circus this would deliver, with Thompson
at the heart of it. Traveling down the coast in a bus Thompson develops
a deep disgust with Ed Muskie and is implicit in unleashing Peter
Sheridan on the Ed Muskie campaign. He is at the Watergate hotel when
Nixon’s men break in to bug the Democrats’ rooms. He is there to help
his chosen candidate McGovern briefly rise, only to falter once more.
1972 was no 1968, but it still had the attempted assassination of George
Wallace (the man who was Trump before Trump was Trump) and the, (im)
probable victory again of the conniving paper bag of a man known as
Nixon. This election – and more directly the Watergate fallout from it
shortly thereafter – would bring Thompson back to DC and bring him into
a newfound habit, cocaine, and out of his relationship with a divorce
from Sandy. The book ends here and so, too does Thompson’s rising star.
He remained relevant, important and famous til his death in 2005
(suicide), but all of those – his relevancy, his importance, his fame
and, critically, his ability to write – would decline steady over that
period. From this book you wouldn’t know that as it end at the apex, but
it is clear that no one has the stamina to overcome the abuse his body
and mind took to create this magic decade of Gonzo Journalism. RIP.</p>

<h4><a href="https://markbittman.com/avj">Animal, Vegetable, Junk: A
History of Food from Sustainable to Suicidal</a></h4>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>By : Mark Bittman</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>This a book about food. The food system, to be more precise. It is
also a book about politics and public health, the environment and the
economy, history and human biology and how the food system plays a
central role in all of these and more. Bittman’s central thesis is that
how we have grown to organize ourselves to both create and consume food
is a (the?) driving factor in many of mankind’s greatest successes and
nearly all of our current, existential issues. To focus attention on the
structural nature of the problem, Bittman provides a simple construct;
We used to grow food to provide adequate sustenance to people, over time
we have pivoted to to growing food to create profit. And this change has
made all the difference.</p>
<p>Many an ancient history seminar begins with the invention of
agriculture as humankind’s first step; our initial foray into
civilization as we know it. This is not a wrong place to start. From
agriculture spawned technology, cities, specialization and, importantly,
population growth. On the flip side, the advent of agriculture also
brought greater class and gender distinctions, injustice, slavery,
increased disease, rules about property, wars about that property and,
interestingly, an overall reduction in life span of the, now much
larger, group of humans on the planet. As such, it could be argued –
with myriad supporting evidence – that from day 1 agriculture may not
have been contributing to the healthy sustenance of all humans; its woes
span health, economy, ecology and society.</p>
<p>Agriculture grew with civilization, or perhaps the other way around,
with processes and theories from one mirroring the other. For example,
following the dominant thinking of the mid-1800s , agriculture became
reductionist. Its chief misstep here was in treating soil as a raw
material to farming and not as an ecological partner in food production.
It relegated the bounty of the earth’s soil to that of a stock to be
exploited and not a flow to be maintained. Doing so offered incredible
short term gains in productivity (yields). Population boomed, farmland
expanded, fortunes were made and farming became Big Agriculture. We were
now ‘scaled’ and ready to exponentially multiply our ability to support
human life on the planet, learning nothing from earlier civilizations’
failures to overcome local soil depletion.</p>
<p>Scaling Big Ag meant going global. Local markets could no longer
handle the vast supplies of staple crops that were produced on the
world’s premier farmlands. American cotton flooded Indian markets,
American corn was forced upon Mexico and Asian wheat and rice brought to
Africa. In the process local farmers were driven out of business due to
dropping prices leading to famines and eventual migration crises. Big Ag
also meant optimization and efficiency. The farm became a factory
complete with tractors, machines elevators and electrical milking
machines. On the one hand these saved farmers from hours of manual
labor; on the other they brought crushing debts. Most of the money to be
made in farming in the 20th century was in being a financier, seed
supplier or tractor manufacturer.</p>
<p>Factory make things, they don’t grow them. So too, our food began
being ‘made’ and not grown on a farm, field or orchard nor hunted nor
gathered. People, animals and plants became inputs to a mechanized
process that used some combination of machinery, electricity and these
inputs to produce food products. Along with this, nutrition became
regarded as a game of numbers, just get some protein and fat and mostly
carbohydrates and you’ll be fine. Additionally, as food became a factory
good, agriculture became an industry complete with lobbyists, think
tanks and multinational corporations. It became the domain of marketers
and chemists, not cooks and farmers. With the advent of the supermarket,
shoppers lost their connection to a local, knowledgeable grocer and were
left to make nutrition decisions on their own, using nothing more than
product labeling themselves…guided of course by the likes of
industry-funded personalities like Betty Crocker. Despite the vast
increase in total consumable calories, health decreased and, for
example, many men signing up for duty in WWII were found to have vitamin
deficiencies, many more than just 30 years prior in WWI.</p>
<p>After WWII, the conventional story on food highlights the ‘Green
Revolution’ and how we had lifted much of the entire world out of
poverty via more technological farming. In reality, the Green Revolution
was more of the same soil-degrading, petroleum-leveraged, high-yield,
monocropping as before, with many similar nutritional impacts on local
populations. Chicken and soy began to take over as the key protein
components, mothers began to give up breast milk for formula and fast
food joints flooded low income neighborhoods using federal grants.
Farming yields continued to rise, while farmers went bankrupt, our
topsoil eroded away and our western waistlines continued to expand.</p>
<p>The US was a large beneficiary of the Green Revolution. It had (and
still has) some of the best farmland in the world. Farmland which was
practically given away to white European settlers in great midwestern
land rushes. Additionally, unlike many agricultural producers in the
colonial areas whose profits were extracted by the colonizers, the US
was able to use its agricultural might to develop its economy, its
country and eventually its military might. It is no exaggeration to say
that its agricultural surplus was critical to its ascension as a super
power. As the global power of food production increased, so too did its
ability to be used as a political tool…a process the continues today as
the US, EU and China vie for expanded global reach often through
generous food grants.</p>
<p>In sum, Bittman argues that to truly grasp the nature of the problem,
we must shift our framing. Big agriculture, as currently practiced, is
akin to mining. It takes from the soil and the water and the workers for
short term gain ignoring any form of externalities. No process in a
closed system like our planet can ignore externalities forever, eventual
they will cripple it. He argues that our current system cannot survive;
it is not sustainable. In its place is offered a human-centered,
laborious system centered on ‘agroecology’ and regenerative farming. To
get there we must change our personal decisions as well as the larger
system; only fixing one variable in the equation will not solve this
problem. And, to those who say a less ‘modern’ approach is too
expensive, Bittman is quick to note that the current system was built on
billions if not trillions of dollars of government subsidies; we can do
the same to create a more sustainable and equitable future state.</p>
<p>Animal, Vegetable, Junk is a fascinating, whirlwind tour of food
production.It is not without its political leanings; though strongly
evidenced and keenly argued. The growth of our western obesity epidemic,
the global migration crises driven by out of work farmers and slow
emergencies like the draining of the Ogallala are hard to ignore. Woven
into the moving narrative are juicy bits of historical trivia like the
story behind the rise of Heinz Ketchup, the Cherokee boycott of $20
bills and the doxing of Betty Crocker. It is an engaging book, but be
forewarned that you may never look at your food the same way
again…especially your ketchup.</p>

<h4><a
href="https://www.thepaintedporch.com/products/philosophy15">Meditations</a></h4>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>By : Marcus Aurelius (translated by Gregory Hays)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>It takes minimal, if any, imagination to feel, to really feel, the
author struggling with his own thoughts and actions. From the first word
to the last, he is there with you willing himself to think and behave in
a manner befitting his upbringing, his station and his philosophy. His
words will leave you both inspired by their noble calling and
embarrassed at your own trivialities and moral failings. But, be easy on
yourself for you are reading, perhaps, the best example we have of
Plato’s Philosopher King. A man of both power and introspection; of fame
and wealth who is concerned for neither; a man who ruled over millions
but struggled to rule over himself (as we all do) and admitted as much.
These are his personal notes, his diary, his self-therapy, live-Tweet,
stream of consciousness. In all likelihood no other historical or modern
work has exceeded its intended audience (one) by such a large ratio
(tens of millions).</p>
<p>There is no plot, no progression of ideas, no true beginning or end.
One could conceivable start reading from any one point and read in
either direction and lose nothing. Ideas surface and re-surface,
re-phrased or contextualized differently on different pages. Colored, no
doubt, by his mood, the weather, recent interactions with the barbarian
tribes on the Germanic front or the reports about scheming senators back
in Rome. The places and people are contemporaries; however, replacing
them with generic or modern ones would change nothing about the book.
The repetition and re-statement begins as a mild annoyance but morphs
into a comfort, a re-assurance that there are only a minimal set of
principles on which to focus your efforts and around which to build a
good life. And focus, you should.</p>
<p>Distilled, Aurelius chides himself persistently to do the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take objective stock of what has happened. Assent to its occurrence
regardless of your feelings for it.<br />
</li>
<li>Determine if a thing is within your control or not within your
control. Ignore those that are not.</li>
<li>In both your thoughts and actions, eliminate the noise. Put all your
energy into the essential; those that are in your control.</li>
<li>Do not desire, be content and instead imagine what it would be like
to lose what you have.</li>
<li>Do the hard work without complaint and let obstacles power you on
your journey to put the world in order</li>
<li>Think precise thoughts, say meaningful words, engage in intentional
and unselfish actions all of which should focus on the collective good
and on furthering justice.</li>
<li>Treat others well and seek to understand them. Their actions have
rationales just like your own.</li>
<li>Be present, it is all we have.</li>
<li>A good life is one defined by virtue, not status or material things.
Anyone in any situation can do this.</li>
</ul>
<p>High standards, no doubt. Meditations has become canon for Stoicism,
an ancient Greek philosophy practiced by many Romans and making a
comeback today. These principles, though, are not Stoicism’s alone. In
some form many of them find their way into all manner of philosophies,
religion, belief structures, coaching paradigms, inspirational posters
and social media memes. A testament both to the timelessness of Marcus
Aurelius’s ethos and the degree to which human nature and our
interactions with others have changed so very little in the last 2,000
years.</p>
<p>This work and the author, like any, are far from perfect. Fault can
be found with his failure to acknowledge Roman’s strict class system as
being antithetical to the common good. As well as with the dominating
sense of determinism that pervades his thinking. Accepting such a state
of affairs may be freeing for the most powerful man in the world – it
removes any sense of responsibility for it – but suffocating to those of
the lowest station, those suffering the injustice. We are all products
of our environment, Roman Emperors, even good ones, no different.</p>
<p>This is a deep book, yet one that can be consumed in bit-sized
pieces. As such, it is no wonder such a far ranging set of influential
people – Thomas Jefferson, Beatrice Webb, Wen Jiabao and Bill Clinton,
to name a few – have noted its importance in their own journeys. The
clear and concise guidance is well-suited to our modern age of short
attention spans and 140 character limits. Being a collection of
thoughts, there are dozens if not hundreds of ‘quote-worthy’ dicta. A
selection (paraphrased) of my favorites to meditate on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop whatever you are doing for a moment and ask yourself: ‘Am I
afraid of death because I won’t be able to do this anymore?’</li>
<li>If you find something better to pursue than truth, justice,
temperance and courage then drop everything else and follow it. If not,
then only make room for these things.</li>
<li>Think only about important things. One should be ready to answer
‘what are you thinking about’ at all times proudly.</li>
<li>One assembles their life action by action</li>
<li>Aim to have a perpetual spring (infinite), not a cistern (finite),
of virtue by practicing patience, honesty and humility</li>
<li>Do the work to put the world in order.</li>

<h4><a
href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/176227/antifragile-by-nassim-nicholas-taleb/">Anti-Fragile:
Things that gain from disorder</a></h4>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>By : Nassim Nicholas Taleb</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>It is work to endure a dense narrative that questions the validity of
many of your life choices, from higher education and data driven
prediction, to 9-to-5 employment and travel planning. This wasn’t my
first try here. Myriad dog-eared pages and underlined passages
throughout the first few chapters attest to my prior failures to finish
this book. This time, I would persevere, knowing full well what I had
signed up for. Not being a serial entrepreneur, a starving artist, a
best-selling author, a mobster or a Medici, i was prepared to be
maligned. Others have it worse as names are named – mostly famous
economists – and few punches held. Amidst Taleb’s bravado, the
sophomoric metaphors and the choppy prose, however, there are some fresh
and fundamentally sound ideas. Ideas that can help individuals and, more
importantly, organizations think long and hard about risk, growth,
volatility, ethics, and the meaning of freedom.</p>
<p>Randomness and uncertainty, chaos and disorder, entropy and error:
the many instantiations of volatility. They are everywhere. In fact,
their presence is the rule and not exception. We tend to consider
responses to volatility to be binary. Either something is robust to
volatility, meaning that is not impacted or it is fragile to volatility,
meaning that it is reduced, injured or otherwise worse off because of
it. This binary framework, Taleb tells us, is wrong and this book is his
attempt at explaining why. At the core of his argument and his very
ethos is that there is a third category of response, that which gains
from volatility. The English language doesn’t actually have a word for
this, so Taleb gives us ‘anti-fragile’ to signal that it represents the
exact opposite of fragility – that which loses from volatility. It
lands, initially, as a foreign concept, but in reality we are surrounded
by anti-fragility. Many natural things are anti-fragile: our bodies
(weight lifting and fasting benefit us), ecological systems (evolution,
mutations, food webs) and information itself (controversial ideas/books
are best sellers). Few built or created things, however, are: political
structures, economic systems, everyday home items, investment
strategies, etc. are all usually fragile, or at their best robust.
Broadly speaking, big, fast, efficient and concentrated things are
fragile; small, slow, redundant and dispersed things can be
anti-fragile. And, it should be noted that many (most) anti-fragile
things need volatility or they will suffer with our bodies and our
ecosystem being prime examples. <em>On no fewer than a half dozen
occasions Taleb reminds us that most human ailments are caused by
chronic stress injuries due to lack of variety in bodily
movement.</em></p>
<p>To be anti-fragile two conditions must exist, optionality and
rationality. Optionality requires that there be a position such that one
can act, but is not forced to act. Rationality requires a method of
decision making (selection) that can identify when an event (a deviation
from stasis) has made the situation better off than before. For the
followers of Greek Mythology (of which the author is one), one needs be
both a Dionysian (to generate options) and a Apollonion (to rationally
choose among them). Simple, right? The key, of course, is in identifying
situations where optionality exists. Optionality is borne from postive
asymmetries, situations where you find yourself with more upside than
downside. These asymmetries result from non-linearities in the response
of a thing to an event, or, put another way, the difference between a
thing and the function of a thing. If a thing can benefit greatly
(mildly) but suffer a small (large) harm then it is convex (concave) to
an event. Convexities represent anti-fragile situations for you;
concave, fragile. It is crucial to understand that such situations
rarely exists in ludic, or strictly rule-based situations (like a casino
or game). On the other hand, when found they exist in the big, messy and
complex ecological systems in which our environment, economy and
politics operate. Importantly, when you are in an anti-fragile position,
you want volatility…which, volatility being endemic, is a good
thing.<br />
The story of anti-fragility, however, is not just one of a few
enlightened individuals, groups and societies leveraging asymmetries and
optionality to create a gilded utopia. Two problems have arisen. First,
we are much more connected, efficient, fast and big as a global
society…meaning that we are also much more fragile than we used to be.
Look no further than the 2008 global financial crisis or the recent
COVID-based supply chains issues of 2020/21. Second, ethical issues
arise from anti-fragility. A core part of the anti-fragility story is
that of bad actors ‘stealing’ anti-fragility from others; generally,
private individuals using un-ethical means to create optionality for
themselves at the cost (fragility) of the public. These are violations
of the first order, those I’d consider serious, punishable and worthy of
efforts to regulate. Taleb also spends considerable ink discussing more
minor infractions such as the giving of bad advice, most by academics
and the media. Here, he advocates for the wise (the non-turkeys) to
ignore any opinion in which there is not bona fide proof of ‘skin in the
game’ on the account of the prognosticator. A worthy claim, no doubt,
but ultimately tangential to the narrative. Such asides are a common
trial for the reader.</p>
<p>Practically, what does all this talk of convexities, the Dionysion
and ludic systems boil down to?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don’t predict; rank order your choices by
(anti-)fragility.</strong> Instead of worrying about being overly smart
with sophisticated predictions, spend your time identifying asymmetries
and non-linearities and invest your time/money/effort where you have a
big upside and a small downside.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Stop solving every problem with addition:</strong> In many
cases – health, politics, love, portfolio risk management, sports,
gardening – a good outcome is usually just the absence of the bad. Focus
first on removing bad (fragile) things before you add any new ones, what
remains will often be the anti-fragile.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Relish the old:</strong> If you must add something new,
choose something that has been around a long time as these are the most
are likely to remain; those that haven’t are likely to go away (Lindy’s
Law of Non-Perishable Things). Time is greatest detector of
fragility.</li>
<li><strong>Think like a Roman Stoic:</strong> See the upside, devalue
possessions and status, love fate and accept the challenges it brings by
creating your own asymmetries. Will yourself to be anti-fragile to
volatility by your attitude and your actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>No lie, this is a tough book. And not just because the thesis runs
counter to much of my path in life. It offers a deep and, at times,
counter-intuitive argument presented in an unorthodox manner. However,
it will change your thinking if you let it, though how much is
ultimately up to you.</p>

<h4><a
href="https://www.epi.org/publication/the-color-of-law-a-forgotten-history-of-how-our-government-segregated-america/">The
Color of Law</a></h4>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>By : Richard Rothstein</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Racial segregation in the housing market was a present, but not
central theme throughout my post-graduate education in Urban Planning .
We discussed destructive measures – The Highway Act of 1956 and
redlining – as well as some adjudicative ones – integrative busing and
public housing projects. However, only after finishing Richard
Rothstein’s ‘The Color of Law’ has the extent of the discriminatory
actions perpetuated on and endured by African Americans in regards to
housing been made clear to me.</p>
<p>The central thesis of ‘The Color of Law’ is that racial segregation
in America is the direct product of de jure (by law and policy) not de
facto (occurring on its own) segregation. And, that African Americans
were denied, unconstitutionally so, the right to integrate into
middle-class neighborhoods for much of the 20th century. The evidence
presented here in support of this argument is copious, well-documented,
damning, and, at times, difficult to read.</p>
<p>Redlining – the refusal of banks to provide mortgages within
historically African-American neighborhoods – is the poster child for
disgraceful and racist corporate action in housing. While a major player
in the wrongs perpetuated on communities of color, it is far from the
only or perhaps even the most severe obstacle facing integration.
Significant and often illegal hurdles were erected (and supported by
courts and law enforcement) across nearly every aspect of housing:
Lending, Construction Funding, Taxes, Zoning, Courts, Income/Wealth
Generation, Rental Markets, Policing, Real Estate Agents and Developers.
Example of these include only offering low LTV loans to whites, the FHA
only providing construction financing to white-only suburbs post WWII,
the IRS failing to revoke tax exempt status for firms that discriminated
(as the law required), the Supreme Court ruling (in 2007) in favor of a
de facto explanation of current segregation, single-family only zoning
throughout most of the country, government agencies refusing to enforce
anti-segregationist hiring practices, police standing by as black
homeowners in white neighborhoods were vandalized and real estate agents
and developers coordinating to ‘blockbust’ transitioning neighborhoods
for their own speculative gain. These are just a few of the policies and
practices that were commonplace during the 20th Century in America.</p>
<p>None of these discriminatory housing-related actions were by and
alone responsible for our segregated cities, schools and, ultimately,
lives. Labor policies – by limiting African American participation in
growing industries – also contributed greatly to confining their
communities. Rothstein cedes the point that some amount of segregation,
or clustering of people with those like them is always bound to happen,
but the sheer scale of the actions taken to keep African Americans away
from whites and the fervor with which Blacks fought to break down these
customs and regulations suggests that the amount of segregation both
past and current is anything but the pure result of natural sorting.</p>
<p>As a closing salvo, we are reminded that as opposed to previous
segregated services or domains like busing, restaurants, businesses,
theaters, sporting events, etc., housing has a history. Once you
desegregate the busses, within a few weeks or months, everyone can fully
enjoy the same quality services. Same with a restaurant or a theater.
But housing has a deep structural legacy. It holds and imparts
generational wealth. It helps build the foundational social networks
that will help guide young adults to success (or failure). Health, both
physical and mental, are shaped by housing. In short, where you live
matters a great deal in this country; so too does where your parents
lived and their parents before them. When those choices are heavily
constrained, the consequences of those limitations are not easily
erased. The structural legacy of racist housing policy has a long
half-life and, as Rothstein reminds us here, we are still living through
much of the fallout.</p>

the Great Unknown</a></h4>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>By : Edward Dolnick</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>By 1869 the growing American nation had filled in the vast majority
map between the Atlantic and the Pacific. The great remaining unknown
was the Grand Canyon. Pioneers and cartographers knew what went into it
and what came out, but what happened within it was a mystery to the
leaders of this new(ish) nation-state. A one-armed Civil War veteran by
the name of John Wesley Powell set out to change that.</p>
<p>With the clarity of a century and half’s worth of hindsight, this
endeavor could be rightfully considered ‘Powell’s Folly’. Yet, just over
three months after pushing off from Green River, WY, six of the origin
ten men emerged from the southern exit of the canyon; bruised and
battered, harried and hungry, but triumphant. Dolnick’s account – based
on a thorough review and interweaving of the various journals kept
during the trip and penned afterwards – lays bare Powell’s faulty
planning and tactics as well as his dedication to the geological goals
of the mission and, importantly, his enduring positivity.</p>
<p>Heaps of bacon and flour. A wide variety of scientific instruments.
Ten men, one missing a hand. No maps. No life jackets. No experience on
whitewater. And four boats built for the placid lakes of the Northeast.
Such began the journey down the Grand Canyon. Well, actually, just
getting down the Green River and through the middle Colorado would prove
challenging enough, let alone the final act through the mysterious cleft
in the earth. To say there were mishaps would be a gross understatement.
It would be an injustice of a similar scale to attribute their success
to luck alone. Their journals freely concede the ebb and flow of
adventure. The highs of successfully running a rapid or a hunt that
resulted in wild game for dinner. And the lows of days on end of lining
rapids with the only reward a plate of unleavened bread and coffee. In
the end, they not only finished the remarkable trek but also contributed
greatly to the contemporaneous geological discussions by providing rich
and compelling data that underlies some of our deepest understandings of
the history of our planet.</p>
<p>For all the glory, there is equivalent sadness. Three of the men lost
their lives, not on the water but in hiking out to safety. The deaths
are clouded in conspiracy, originally blamed on local tribes but without
any evidence to support the claim. Equally, we can mourn the loss of the
natural wonders of the Glen Canyon to its concrete jailer. We now live
in an age where the un-mapped has been relegated to the deep sea or deep
space, as such we struggle to grasp the both danger and pureness of it
and the significance of its loss.</p>
<p>This book can run lax at time, bordering on tedium, but also sparkles
with interesting parallel tales of adventures, a quick course on modern
whitewater rafting and an enticing thread on Powell, the scientist. It
is a book you can put down, a book that will lull you, literally, to
sleep at times, but also one that will leave you in awe of immensity of
the gamble they took and display of grit needed to complete the
task.</p>

<h4><a
href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Desert-Solitaire/Edward-Abbey/9780671695880">Desert
Solitaire</a></h4>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>By : Edward Abbey</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Of the original 1960s renegade environmentalists, Edward Abbey may be
the most controversial. Like him or not, Desert Solitaire, a tale of his
summer as a ranger in Arches National Park, has become a canon of the
early ‘eco’ movement. Now, more than fifty years later, Desert Solitaire
remains as relevant as ever in an ecological-philosophical sense. His
contribution in this space – both this book and his wider work – merits
little disagreement. Abbey’s writing extends well beyond the bounds of
environmental argument as well. Here in the political and cultural, his
positions may lie at odds with many in the broader modern environmental
movement. The misanthropic rants are, perhaps, forgivable, leveled more
at the systems of human organization (the evils of culture and
institutions) and not individuals themselves. His misogyny is more
subdued, but evident nonetheless. Perhaps a parlance of his time or
station, but readily re-enforced by his familial performance. Other
prejudices lurk at times, but are also openly condemned at others. A
multitude of opinions of Abbey, the man, could (and are) conceivably and
rightfully be held. I want to avoid this route to the available extent,
focusing on Abbey the ranger, the writer and the raconteur.</p>
<p>Abbey would be terrified at today’s Arches National Park: Paved roads
and pathways deep into the desert, gift shops full of kitsch and Coke
machines, campgrounds littered with RVs and Teslas instead of canvas
tents. Adventure replaced by tourism…everything he feared it would
become. And not just Arches, most of our National Parks – save the far
North; Alaska, Isle Royale, North Cascades, Voyageurs – have, too,
pivoted to cater to the teeming masses. Underneath the cutting prose and
occasional fits of anger, Abbey was also a highly skilled story teller.
A fact that is no more evident in that you can find yourself in abject
disagreement with a statement, hypothesis or the ethos of his and, yet,
find his work deeply insightful.</p>
<p>Desert Solitaire, arguably his finest work, is three threads woven
together: Deed, Description and Doctrine. The things he did during his
summer as a ranger (Deed), a rich explanation of the ecology of
southeast Utah together with a general census of the region
(Description) and a haphazard collection of his strongly held beliefs on
public land policy, immigration and other tangential philosophical
musings all roughly related to the ideal state of man in the modern
world (Doctrine). No one of these dominates the book; a reader gets all
three in heavy dose.</p>
<p>What does an adventurous park ranger do during his days off around
Moab? Quite a bit, actually: going on cattle drives, squatting in an
abandoned mine camp in the Havasupai Canyon, exploring the remote and
uncharted Maze formation, removing road survey markers, stalking a
one-eyed, feral horse, climbing up Mt. Tukuhnikivatz, rafting down Glen
Canyon (pre-dam), helping find a dead man and then nearly becoming one
on a subsequent adventure. All this along with frequent trips to town to
consume 3.2 beer with a Basque cowboy and others in one of Utah’s least
Morman towns.</p>
<p>For his summer’s work Abbey resided in a remote tin trailer many
miles from the park’s headquarters. His neighbors the snakes and geckos,
the juniper and cliffrose, the dust and sandstone. All are given their
due, with details often bordering on encyclopedic. These deep asides
into the natural environment form an import scaffolding for the thesis
of the book and his larger ethos; as an arm-chair environmentalist my
attention wandered unable to lean into a sprawling narrative on the
mating habits of gopher snakes. I find fault mostly with the reader in
this case.</p>
<p>Sharing a campfire and a six-pack with Abbey would, no doubt, have
resulted in few dull moments. He had many opinions, strongly held. Core
to these were a deep hatred for bureaucracy and development, a
not-so-uncommon position for a young man from meager means who endured a
relatively unsuccessful military career. He found freedom in the desert,
a freedom which ‘industrial tourism’ would threaten to end. Abbey’s
track record is mixed. His ideas to fix the National Parks – centered
around removing the automobile – have been slowly implemented and are
likely to gain momentum as visitor numbers rise and infrastructure
remains insufficient. In these, he is sage. His anti-immigration,
anti-urban philosophy bears more checkered results. In this, Abbey
offers a selfishness similar to that leveled at today’s wealthy,
ecologically-minded adventurers. Namely that the parks (nature, really)
belong to the able, both physical and financial. Missing from Abbey’s
worldview is this acute fact that we can better save wilderness with a
big-tent, consensus-building approach, driven mostly by the dominant
population group – urbanites – that he so loved to malign. Hubris on his
part, for sure, but also somewhat apropos for the time (the late 1960s).
Our understanding of resource consumption, development and the larger
human footprint in general have evolved considerably in the past 50
years, along with a doubling of the world’s population in that time.</p>
<p>Desert Solitaire is not a story, per se, no linear progression of
plot, nor any real character development. Its an extremely well-written
journal of man’s summer in south-eastern Utah. A pre-industrial tourism,
pre-big hydropower paean to the high desert. Enjoy it for that view,
regardless of your position on the author and his wide ranging feelings
on the ills of modern (wo)man.</p>

River: Finding and Losing the Northwest Passage</a></h4>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>By : Brian Castner</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>In the far southwestern corner of Great Slave Lake the Deh Cho river
begins its 1,000 mile journey to the sea. The outlet flow west; west
toward the Pacific. In the late 1800s such a course held infinite
potential. Could it be the Northwest Passage? A riverine highway
directly to Chinese markets where furs sold for ten times what they did
in Montreal or London. Was the Deh Cho the river that would open up the
far north of the continent? The river that would make men rich beyond
their wildest dreams?</p>
<p>A few hundred miles after leaving the lake, the Deh Cho makes a turn
north and continues that direction eventually emptying into the icy
Arctic Ocean. Alexander Mackenzie was the first European to traverse the
great river – now bearing his name. The first of the fur trappers to
fight the storms, the hunger, the bugs and the maze-like delta only to
be rewarded with an ice-clogged sea providing access to precisely
nowhere. His course in life would end up mirroring that of the river’s;
beginning rich with potential only to end in disappointment. Not in
tragedy but irrelevance. This is the story of that river, his life and
the author’s own attempt to re-create Mackenzie’s journey.</p>
<p>The tales of the parallel endeavors smoothly complement each other.
Mackenzie’s story providing deep insight into the politics of the great
trading companies of the north and the culture of the indigenous tribes
of this immense land mass. Stoic to a fault, we get very few glimpses of
the difficulty of Mackenzie’s undertaking from his journals. There are
marked points about the shortcomings of his traveling companions, for
sure, but not much that one would ascribe to pure complaint. He is
mostly concerned with recording navigational and reconnaissance details,
no doubt in hope that this information will help turn the river into the
fur trader’s Silk Road. An optimistic reader of his account may be left
with the impression that paddling the Mackenzie is simply a matter of
patience in letting the river carry you to the sea.</p>
<p>Here is where Castner’s own trip shines. His telling lays out the
gory details of the struggles of running this river. How the wind
creates three-foot waves in one-foot deep water. How one must search for
hours to find a suitable sand bar to place a small tent. How the bugs
can turn exposed skin into festering wounds in a matter of minutes.
Don’t worry though, it is not all woe. Castner finds genuine bonds with
his rotating cast of paddling partners and well as a number of the
locals – primarily members of the remaining indigenous peoples. While
the river may be uncaring, there is a personal element, even this far
north. In that respect, Castner, like Mackenzie and like their fellow
European adventures between them, relied on the good will of the native
people for survival.</p>
<p>If you are looking for intense, page-turning action scenes this book,
like the river itself, will disappoint. There probably won’t be a film
adaption. In neither story is there really excitement, only drudgery.
But, you learn to appreciate the struggles, both mental and physical.
Its a long, hard grind. Literally millions of paddle strokes (and
Castner only went downstream, the easy way). It is 14-16 hours a day of
monotony, followed by frantic searches for campsites before nightfall,
or what amounts to it this far north in June. It is sitting all day, all
week, looking at the same black spruce trees and gray water for time on
end. A grand adventure no doubt, but one of discipline and endurance,
not high action.</p>
<p>The book is well done; a balanced mix of history and personal
connection. It will quickly avail you of any sense of propriety
surrounding your own daily troubles here in the modern world. The book,
as published, is also inferiorating. There are no maps to guide you, no
reference to traditional tribal land boundaries, no easy way to keep
track of either party’s progress. I spent a good portion of my reading
this trying to place the paddlers on Google Maps. In retrospect maybe,
just maybe, this was intentional. To put you in Mackenzie’s shoes in
heading into the unknown with nothing but poorly translated local wisdom
to guide you.</p>

<h4><a

Astor and Jefferson’s Lost Pacific Empire</a></h4>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>By : Peter Stark</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Astoria, Oregon is a sleepy town near the mouth of the Columbia River
known mostly for its horrible weather and as the backdrop for Goonies,
the 1980s cult classic. Founded in the early 1800s, its ambitions were
once much grander – nothing less than to be the nexus of global trade in
the Pacific and, possibly, the capital of a new democracy on the left
coast of the continent. Peter Stark’s Astoria captivatingly explores the
driving forces behind this ambitious goal, the idiosyncrasies of the
main players and, ultimately, the reasons for their failed enterprise.
The short answer is greed. And an inability to grasp the vastness of the
continent as well as the psychological toll of isolation and exposure on
the human spirit.</p>
<p>From our nationalist point of view the settlement of the American
West is often told in three parts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Jefferson buys the better part of today’s central United States
for a song from Napoleon, after which Lewis &amp; Clark’s Corps of
Discovery have a grand adventure finding the Pacific Ocean paving the
way for:</p></li>
<li><p>The Oregon Trail which brought both settlers en masse as well a
popular video game to the region which, eventually, led to;</p></li>
<li><p>The California Gold Rush, the Railroads and the founding of
wealthy cities all up and down the West Coast.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, we are usually informed, that throughout these three
acts the natives caused all manner of troubles, but in the end Manifest
Destiny was too great of a force for the indigenous people.</p>
<p>Of course this over-simplified treatment leaves out critical
information about the who, the why, the where and the how of our
nation’s march westward. In this book, Stark fills in key details about
what happened after Lewis &amp; Clark had returned home, but before
there was an Oregon Territory.</p>
<p>In those years after the Louisiana Purchase the nascent United States
was intent on expansion, both territorially and economically (often one
in the same). Though the revolution was over and freedom won, the
country’s long term independence was not assured. Lewis &amp; Clark’s
successful expedition spawned uncountable grandiose visions in the heads
of East Coast Americans. The fever reached the highest seats of power.
The country’s most powerful politician, Thomas Jefferson, and its
richest businessman, John Jacob Astor, hatched a plan to settle the West
Coast. Jefferson, with the ambition of founding a sister democracy on
the opposite coast to ensure the safety of the continent. Astor, with
the ambition of a global fur trade empire that could efficiently move
product from the inland rivers of North America to the Chinese markets
where furs fetched astronomical prices. Two parties were dispatched on
the mission: return to the mouth of the Columbia and establish a trading
post which would grow into a capitol city. One by land and one by
sea.</p>
<p>Both reached their ultimate destination, though not on the aggressive
time schedules envisioned. Nor were these journeys as comfortable and
predictable as drawn up in a New York chamber room. But, perhaps, the
biggest mis-step by the backers of this endeavor was their utmost
reliance on the un-wavering focus and commitment of the men involved.
Wars, weather and pure chance matter too, but any plan, like this one,
that doesn’t leave enough contingency for simple human errors is bound
to fail.</p>
<p>Stark’s telling here is commendable. There is no hero worship, no
misplaced nationalistic fervor or racial judgement. You root for some
characters and against others, but only on their merits. You get his
best researched facts in an approachable narrative. Sometimes, perhaps,
too many of them, especially in the latter third of the book when
geopolitics stir the already murky collection of events.</p>
<p>There were two key takeaways for me. First, that it was Astor’s
Overland Group that laid down most of what would become the Oregon
Trail. By leaving the Missouri (for fear of the Blackfeet) they found a
much easier set of passes leading to the Columbia Valley and,
importantly, one that more readily handled covered wagons. Second, the
extent to which early trappers, adventurers and settlers relied on the
native people to both way-find and, often, simply survive. Without help
from the Shoshone, Astor’s men (and one woman) would have surely died in
Hells Canyon. Similarly, a number of Great Plains tribes helped them
around the Bighorn Mountains and out into the Snake River plain. The
Ocean Group benefited greatly from the Native Hawaiians as well. As
interesting, or more so, as the white man’s wanderings are the varied
manner in which the numerous tribes conducted relations with the
explorers and how, in many cases, those interactions were driven by the
on-going inter-tribal conflicts.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you read this I dare you to find a bigger bad ass in all
the world than Marie Dorian, the lone woman of the trip. I won’t spoil
the details here but her story — just a bit part of this expansive drama
— is simply astounding.</p>

<h4><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374277789">The Topeka
School</a></h4>

<ul>
<li>By : Ben Lerner</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Come for the writing; stay for the story. Or maybe it is the other
way around. You’ll find the presentation is not simple, nor linear. It
begins in a bricolage of perspectives and story lines, but stick it out,
the plot will narrow and you’ll be rewarded. Along the way you get Bob
Dole, a Taipei brothel, crystal meth, Ivanka Trump, Westboro Church,
those kids from your high school, that parent at the park, the
patriarchal underbelly of every small community, remorse, anger,
forgiveness and a little bit of laughter.</p>
<p>The author (also the protagonist) is a white male, my age; a fellow
product of the mid- to late-1990s Middle American mono-culture. While
our similarities end there, the shared vintage of our adolescence
conjured a number of not-so-comfortable memories from my own past. Peel
away the personal history narratives – the book is primarily written in
the ‘then’ – you find that this book is really about the ‘now’. It is a
look at how language, its use, abuse and failure to master, are
contributing to where we, America, find ourselves in 2020. Toxic
masculinity is an principal theme, with information overload and abuse
of privilege broached as well.</p>
<p>Lerner’s high school debate history provides a core thread through
the narrative. The stories are funny, the characters laughable, pitiable
or hate-able, often all three. From these anecdotes, however, arise two
key concepts – the ‘spread’ and the ‘hyperbolic descent.’ The former is
the author’s term, and the more explored of the two. The latter is my
own tagging of a maneuver (theme), one somewhat orthogonal to the
former.</p>
<p>The ‘spread’ is a debate move whereby one rapidly presents as many
points of argument as quickly as humanly possible. Your opponent has a
higher burden on duty in terms of refutation and, therefore, in the name
of time, can only address some of the original points. The dropped or
ignored points are considered as accepted and are scored as points for
the first speaker. Lerner hints that this same process is writ large in
today’s political world in which an abundance of rapid and successive
lies and/or violations of laws, customs or norms cannot be properly
refuted by your opponent and thus become either truth or are normalized.
It is evident how effectively the current administration has utilized
this technique to its own advantage. More broadly, this is also true
outside the political realm where the average citizen is overwhelmed
daily by social media misinformation, scam artists, needy charities,
global and local catastrophes (current or impending) and personal
economic and health challenges. What gets dropped (ignored) is taken by
its progenitor to be accepted or allowed.</p>
<p>Where the ‘spread’ is wide and shallow, the hyperbolic descent is
narrow and deep. It works something like this. Your opponent offers a
new policy, say, for an extended food stamp program. The response from
hyperbolic descent is that such a program would create dependency on
government, which leads to mass unemployment, which leads to the
unraveling of society, which leads to decreased ability of America to
defend itself internationally, which leads to nuclear war and the end of
human civilization. Every policy or argued point leads directly –
through a ridiculous linear progression – to the end of civilization.
Higher gasoline taxes? Causes nuclear war. Lowering the retirement age?
Nuclear war. Banning single use plastic bags? Yep, nuclear war. Mail-in
voting? You got it, nuclear war. Every and anything your opponent offers
is six steps or less from wiping out the entire human race. Sound
familiar? You’ll find it in most any public comment section of a online
article, if you so dare to venture into the comments.</p>
<p>Lerner’s reflections on language, its power and its abuse are wrapped
into an intriguing, but not quite riveting, coming of age story. The
three additional character view points exist to support the drama of the
protagonist’s, but each offer their own amusing and insightful
contributions to the meta-themes of the book. Additionally, with Klaus,
a minor character, holocaust survivor and oddball mystic, Lerner
channels his deepest critique of what some in our generation, our
country have become. Klaus suggests that our crisis of privilege, of
finding hate, depression and self-loathing amidst utter abundance
represents our desire for “adolescence without end.” For power and
control and freedom without responsibility and commitment. For a free
lunch.</p>

<h4><a
href="https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/stephanie-kelton/the-deficit-myth/9781541736184/">The
Deficit Myth</a></h4>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>By : Stephanie Kelton</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>According to my Twitter feed, Stephanie Kelton’s The Deficit Myth
would change the way that I thought about taxing and budgeting, about
politics, about how our economy actually works. Those are bold claims;
lofty expectations. The book delivered as promised.</p>
<p>The thesis, simply put: If a county has monetary sovereignty then its
spending is limited only by inflation and real resource constraints and
not by deficits and debt. And, if that doesn’t spin your head quickly
enough you’ll also discover that taxes don’t actually pay for spending
at the Federal level. This all sounds like pure insanity. And in a way
it is. Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) — the larger academic endeavor for
which this book stands as a user-friendly manual — offers such a radical
and abrupt departure from what passes for accepted tenets in the
macro-economic policy world that you’ll find it crazy that we’ve gone so
long, wasted so much economic growth, and stunted so many productive
lives under these false pretenses.</p>
<p>To better understand the above we must, oddly enough, begin with
Richard Nixon. In 1971 Nixon canceled dollar-to-gold convertibility, a
component of the original 1940s Bretton Woods agreement. The US dollar
was now just paper. Fiat, plain and simple. Its value based on society’s
acceptance of its worth in trade and nothing more. Interestingly enough,
as Kelton lays out in this book, the free floating-ness of a fiat
currency has a number of legitimate monetary and fiscal benefits.</p>
<p>Having a fiat currency allows our government to pay off our debt
whenever we want. Just print the money. Actually, it is even easier than
that. Simply have the Fed buy back the Treasuries by digitally crediting
the accounts of the bond holders. Done. No more national debt. The risk,
of course, is inflation. Kelton spends the first half of the book
meticulously guiding the reader through the logic of how a currency
issuer (US government) can, and should, act differently from currency
users (the rest of us). For a currency issuer, spending is not bad. In
fact, it is the only way more money is ever added to an economy. When
the government spends too much (little) a deficit (surplus) results for
the currency issuer but everyone else faces a surplus (deficit).
Surpluses in the non-federal government sector are good, that means all
of us are getting wealthier, as a whole. But again, this is only
desirable so long as it doesn’t cause too much inflation. The root of
inflation is a situation where the group of currency users has more
money then the real resources in the economy on which it can be spent.
In such a case, demand outstrips supply, prices get bid up and you get
undesirable inflation. The key here is the level of real resources — the
products, services, jobs, natural resources, intellectual property,
workers, etc. Where there are idle resources, say mass unemployment and
warehouses of things that the unemployed can’t buy, there is enough
‘slack’ in the economy to handle more spending without causing
inflation. Simply put, demand is too low to bid up prices. This is when
the currency issuer should spend. Not doing so causes lost economic
output, unmet potential and unnecessary human suffering. Imagine the
economy as a half-filled balloon. A government deficit would put more
air into the balloon, a surplus would take air out. So long as we don’t
overfill the balloon (inflation) we get a better result with a deficit
than a surplus.</p>
<p>The spending side is easily grasped. What child hasn’t seen a video
of a Treasury printing press and thought ‘why not just make more
money?’. MMT’s thinking around taxes, however, is considerably thornier
to wrap your head around. The belief that taxes pay for government
services is a central tenet of both conservative and liberal ideologies.
For liberals it’s the feel-good reason to send that check in knowing you
are supporting a safety net for others; with conservatives this
connection gives rise to the ‘no new taxes’ mantra, preferring to let
private actors provide those social services. As Kelton argues that at a
Federal level this simply isn’t true. We spend first, then tax later. So
why then do the Feds tax at all. Instead of funding spending taxes
encourage citizens to act in desirable ways (provide services, cease
smoking, etc.), help control inflation and aid in balancing the
distribution of economic resources thereby attempting to reign in the
political power of the few. We spend to put money in and to direct
economic growth, we tax to take money out (control inflation) and to
direct citizen activities.</p>
<p>There are three additional and important myths insidiously directing
the action on Capital Hill. First, that the interest we pay on our
national debt is bad. The reason we pay interest on the debt — by
allowing holders of savings to buy treasuries — is to to support
interest rates. So long as those interest rates (which since 2009, we
now directly set) are less than the growth rate of the economy, the
interest on the debt is sustainable. The second myth is that trade
deficits are bad. Another way of thinking about a trade deficit is a
‘stuff surplus’. Its not a free lunch, however, as trade deficits can be
bad if they are not covered by deficit spending and/or result in
unemployment. It should also be noted that our trade deficits with
developing nations provide them with the dollars necessary to buy
critical necessities, technology and medicine in the global market. And,
finally, there is the myth that many of our current entitlements —
social security chief among them — are unsustainable. As you may have
guessed from the section on spending, we can always find the money to
pay for an entitlement (especially an ‘earned’ one such as social
security), what’s actually lacking is the stated and ratified guarantee
to do so. In other words, the problem is political not fiscal. Like all
spending, we don’t need the taxes to cover it, only the ‘slack’ in the
economy to spend without creating inflation.</p>
<p>The myth-busting above exists, mostly, in a normative vacuum. It
explains the mechanism by which we can spend more but not necessarily on
what we should be spending. Kelton uses the final chapter of the book to
lay out a plan, both on how MMT envisions handling the inflation risk
while simultaneously building a better a better economy for all
citizens. Ideally, an economy would have an automatic pressure relief
valve that would release (reduce spending) as we ran up against the real
resource limits beyond we’d see undesirable inflation. Kelton offer a
federal job guarantee as a major component of this system. In times of
poor economic conditions, spending would automatically occur as un- and
under-employment citizens fell back on guaranteed federal jobs. This
would stimulate spending and hasten the length of the downturn. As the
economy returned, the private sector would bid workers away from the
federal jobs and spending would decrease. A jobs guarantee program would
obviate the need for many other forms of entitlement spending and would
also create meaningful work products for the public. It would also be a
convenient approach to setting a functional minimum wage without
directly legislating one.</p>
<p>The takeaway: By recognizing the advantages of monetary sovereignty
we can begin to address the deficits that actually matter: a deficit of
well-paying, meaningful jobs, a deficit of equal access to sufficient
health care, a deficit of functioning public infrastructure, and a
deficit of a sustainable relationship with the natural world. Kelton
open our eyes to the fact that most of what lies between us and a better
future is constrained by policy and politics and not by resources or
money.</p>

<div id="war-of-art" class="section level4">
<h4><a href="https://blackirishbooks.com/product/the-war-of-art/">War of
Art</a></h4>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>By : Steven Pressfield</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a self-help book. You may not like self-help books. Even so,
you’ll probably like this book. It is short, easy to read and no
bullshit. Pressfield’s thesis is this: self-generated resistance is what
stands in the way of you becoming an artist, starting a business, losing
weight, quitting smoking, showing political/emotional/social courage
and/or loving. These un-lived lives of art, entrepreneurship, health,
courage and love are what causes poverty, disease and un-happiness. His
cure: do the work. Reject the immediate gratification in favor of the
long term goal by doing the work. Cure your restlessness by doing the
work. Show your contempt for failure by doing the work. Property,
pampering and praise will not bring you joy; doing the work that you
know you must will.</p>
<p>Pressfield lays out four dualities. In each, one side will help you
defeat resistance, the other aids and abets this destructive force. We
begin with the artist and the fundamentalist. The fundamentalist
believes the truth has already been revealed and, as such, cannot
envision a future. With no horizon, fundamentalists are conquered, they
retreat to the past and await the time for humanity to return to a
prior, idealized state. The artist is centered on evolution, progress
and self-mastery. The truth is there to be found; the artist will make
their life a liberating quest toward it.</p>
<p>Next, the professional and the amateur. The amateur dabbles. The
amateur is present in good times and gone in bad. The amateur makes big
plans and fails to deliver. The amateur engages for pleasure. Resistance
crushes the amateur. The professional shows up, no matter what. Puts in
the work, is realistic about deadlines and commitments and the realities
of doing a thing right. The professional separates the important from
the urgent. The professional is there for the work. Its OK to be an
amateur, just not about things that matter.</p>
<p>Third, the ego and the self. This was certainly the low point of the
book for me. Pressfield’s duality here strays a bit too supernatural to
support the thesis. He knows it too, as this section is caveated as such
and attempts to offer the reader multiple paths of interpretation. The
central argument is that the ego is a self-concerned realist while the
self is a altruistic dreamer. The dreamer is, allegedly, better
positioned to defeat resistance. Perhaps there is something in here…i
didn’t see it.</p>
<p>Pressfield closes with the distinction between hierarchy and
territory. An individual (human or animal) whose identity is rooted in
hierarchy sees themselves as their rank in the societal order. Their
actions, their happiness, their motivation and their self-worth is all
determined by their place in the hierarchy. Their rank is everything,
and it generates a never-ending stream of resistance. The artist and the
professional have no use for the hierarchy. They are concerned only with
the territory, the domain, the field, the truth. For an artist or
professional the territory provides all the needed motivation without
external input. In fact, internally is the only way the territory can
provide the drive to do the work. In a territory there are no short
cuts, no cheating, no nepotism, no office politics. You simply must do
the work and what you get out of it is directly proportional to what you
put in.</p>
<p>The efficacy of the advice in this book, of course, assumes the
reader is in a position to exercise such freedom of action, of choice,
over their life. It is written for an audience of, at the bare minimum,
a measure of some privilege. The author admits as much. The advice here
should not be dismissed because of it. Though ‘art’ is the primary
exemplar throughout the text, the tools here are just as successful in
fighting the resistance that keep us from altruistic aims, principled
stands, political courage, habit eradication and/or empathetic action.
Anything that isn’t easy, that isn’t self-serving and immediately
gratifying elicits resistance. The advise here helps identify and defeat
it. So, do the work to defeat your resistance.</p>

<h4><a href="https://davidepstein.com/the-range/">Range: Why Generalists
Triumph in a Specialized World</a>:</h4>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>By : David Epstein</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The spoils of a graduate school education are myriad; a firm belief
in the necessity of specialization chief among them. In this book,
Epstein argues that our reliance on a deep and narrow pursuit of a
solution is often misplaced. Our trust in and preference for the insight
and opinions of siloed specialists is pervasive in our institutions, our
relationships and often our own minds. But, there are situations – many
of them, in fact – where greater specific knowledge leads to worse
outcomes than broader and shallower understanding. It takes some
un-learning to fully recognize and benefit from the power of generalized
thinking.</p>
<p>The key distinguishing factor is the context of the problem and its
formative learning environment. Epstein marks these as either ‘kind’ or
‘wicked’. Kind problems and learning environments have stable and
exhaustible rule sets. They are optimizable and easily simulated. You
won’t be surprised to learn that in many of these cases, computers have
caught and surpassed human ability. These are also the environments
where deep specialization pays the greatest dividends. Take chess.
Really, the only thing that helps with being a better chess player is
more chess practice. Specialization is positively correlated with
performance.</p>
<p>The complement to kind problems are wicked ones. The rules here
change frequently. So, too, do the inputs, the players and goals.
Optimization is generally not possible; most decisions or choices in a
wicked problem require trade-offs, unquantified and unquantifiable
uncertainties, edge cases and exceptions, limited data and no chance for
repetition. Here, specialization creates blinders; local minima from
which escape is futile. Major life decisions, political policies,
business ventures all originate in wicked learning environments…the
things that shape our lives, our societies and our planet.</p>
<p>Epstein’s position is not that specialization and specialists are
necessarily the problem, rather that they need to be mixed with breadth
and generalists in order to for truly successful decisions and
innovative work to result. Key takeaways include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The importance of building teams with diverse backgrounds</li>
<li>Encouraging or practicing periods of cross-pollination of ideas and
opinions</li>
<li>Including creative expression, not just error correction, in your
practice</li>
<li>When teaching, trading procedural-based pedagogy for one centered on
concepts</li>
</ul>
<p>If the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence (to date)
have taught us anything it is that computers and humans are good at
vastly different things (a form of Moravec’s Paradox). And, though the
Age of the Renaissance (Wo)Man is firmly behind us, generalists are
making a comeback due to their ability to tie together disparate threads
of knowledge into unique and fascinating solutions for wicked problems.
It just so turns out that hobbies, hunches and heuristics can offer
promising leads where deep focus has failed us.</p>

<h4><a
href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/306345/american-nations-by-colin-woodard/">American
Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North
America</a>:</h4>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>By : Colin Woodard</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>It is commonplace today to hear that we, as a nation, are more
divided than ever. Even in this Left Coast latte and laptop Liberal
bubble, its hard to disagree with that sentiment. American Nations
provides both a structural theory of why, but also, perhaps, a
refutation of our calls for contemporary exceptionalism in the matter of
partisanship. The central thesis is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Northern North America (basically everything north of Monterrey,
Mexico) was founded by distinct nations and these nations still exist
today, together with a handful of new nations that have developed over
the past four hundred years. Each nation has its own set of values and
the political movements of (mostly) the US can be explained by the
shifting coalitions between these nations over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Being a history book, the thesis is supported by plenty of facts.
Woodard is a reporter, not an academic, so the story telling is solid,
not amazing, but solid. This can be considered praise as there is only
so much clean narrative you can weave through the tangled web of North
American history. Certainly every PhD in US History has serious concerns
about some aspect of this book, if for nothing else than it’s
Euro-Centric approach. Woodard is very clear that he’s taken such a lens
because this book is ultimately about the ebb and flow of regional
(‘national’ in this sense) power dynamics and its an easier (and perhaps
clearer) story to tell from the framework of the dominant culture.</p>
<p>Allow me to attempt to distill the story into a moderately coherent
and chronological synthesis. First came Spaniards up from Mexico to form
El Norte. But, because they were far from European commerce, the land
arid, the peoples brown, their story must wait. Then came Tidewater
(Jamestown). Their hubris didn’t survive the winter and they ate each
other. Then a flood. Yankeedom arrived in the north with their Puritan
values; second sons of English gentry to the Deep South with their
aristocratic mien. Scotch-Irish rebels came too, but quickly scattered
to the interior to avoid being told how to live (Yankeedom) or put to
work (Deep South). Tidewater recovered, bring better farmers and a more
pragmatic aristocracy this time. Oh, and will the eastern seaboard of
the US was being settled, New France was more or less peacefully
existing (extracting natural resources) with the local indigenous
populations. A rough and tumble commercial hub – a yang to the yin of
the Holy city of Boston – New Netherlands (New York) developed its own
Hanseatic ambitions. German farmers found a swath of land from
Philadelphia due west to be both familiar in climate and soil and far
enough from the virtues of Yankeedom and the vices of the Deep South to
existing largely in peace as the Midlands nation.</p>
<p>Much of the first few centuries of American political history
represent a struggle between Yankeedom and the Deep South to pull the
Midlands, Tidewater and, occasionally, New Netherlands into their
coalition. The Civil War was more of the same. Contemporaneously, the
Left Coast and Far West were being developed. Neither a full clone of an
existing nation, the Left Coast evolved most from Yankeedom stock, and
the Far West from Appalachia. The world wars and the end of American
expansion (save Hawaii and Alaska) brought a tenuous truce as the
federation (the US) turned to its external enemies. Post WWII social
changes again pushed the nations apart: free love, drugs, the
environmental movement, civil rights. The church stepped in to provide a
rallying cry for the Deep South, Appalachia and Tidewater; collectively
the Dixie Block. The religion of the free market pushed the Far West
(perhaps the biggest receipt of government investment) away from
Northern Alliance (Yankeedom, Left Coast and New Netherlands) communal
beliefs, while rich Left Coasters doubled down on ‘liberal’ social and
economic policy.</p>
<p>In sum, Woodard argues that the divide between the Dixie Block and
Northern Alliance remains the defining conflict in our society today.
Further, he insists that what will hold it together, and what has always
held it together, is a functioning and practical central government – a
necessity that looks less present with every passing week. All told, it
is a compelling argument, well presented. I’d add that there has evolved
a second dimension: urban vs rural. I think this is especially so for
rural areas in borderland zones that are not within the core of a nation
and for dense urban areas the country around.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t buy the relatively concise and simplistic theory of
Woodard’s, you’ll pick up concerning revelations about your favorite
historical American, a deeper distrust of people’s motives and greater
appreciation for how tenuous the path from 13 English Colonies starving
through a long winter to global superpower struggling with
self-governance really was as well as the challenges that lie ahead.</p>

<h4><a

Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data</a>:</h4>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>By : Charles Wheelan</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>About 50 pages into this book I thought to myself; ‘they should teach
this in high school’; the ‘this’ being the general statistical literacy
which the book is about. Very shortly thereafter the prescriptiveness
and condescension of that statement hit me and and I thought better of
sharing it openly with anyone. Also, it made me realize I’m old. My
personal feelings aside, Whelan’s clarity of presentation and methodical
march through the basics of applied statistics is broadly approachable.
And funny, to boot. The standard examples like the Monty Hall problem
and laughable reverse causality situations all make an appearance. And
so do new ones, like the Schlitz Beer’s taste test ploy in the 1980s,
which, though commendable, couldn’t save the brand.</p>
<p>All humor and Stats 101 aside, there is deeper layer, a line of
argument that should resonate with data and analytics professionals. It
is that incorrect, misleading and malfeasant uses of statistics are not
the fault of the math itself, but rather the application. In short, no
amount of sophisticated modeling and analysis can overcome bad data,
biased sampling, poor choices of variables and a faulty research design.
More conceptually and, perhaps, normatively, Whelan argues that our
thinking about how to use data has lagged seriously behind our ability
to gather and analyze it. Put another way, we can put a lot of effort
into building very precise models — getting the data, sampling and
variables correct — only to find out later that they are not very
‘accurate’ in the sense of solving the problem we originally intended
to.</p>
<p>Whelan equates data to offensive lineman. As such, they are a
necessary but not sufficient condition for creating an accurate, useful
and honest statistical analysis. Machine learning as a discipline seems
to be coming around to this view as well. Modeling improvements still
matter, but rarely will they improve performance to same level as
greatly increasing the size of the data. Amidst the continuous
improvements in computing power, deep learning and AI in general, it can
be easy to forget the importance of asking the right question and
collecting the right data. This book is an enjoyable read that provides
a gentle reminder of why we do analyses in the first place and how to
ensure that the fundamentals — the lineman — are both efficiently
operating and dutifully respected.</p>

<h4><a

To: Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real World Problems</a>:</h4>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>By : Randall Munroe</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>A decade ago, around a campfire, after many beers, we pondered the
horizontal pressure of an above ground swimming pool. How much force
does the water exert and was it greater for a large but shallow pool or
a tall, but small (in circumference) one? Related, is it more difficult
to displace water in a small versus a large pool? While we did not
answer those questions that night, we did successfully melt an aluminium
can and boil water in a paper cup. If you’ve ever wondered these type of
wonders or experimented these type of experiments then this is your kind
of book (the pool question is covered, btw). Basically a
‘deeply-researched and somewhat obscene answers to questions you are
usually too sober or too embarrassed to ask’ book.</p>
<p>Munroe is the author of the XKCD comic strip; well known in some
circles, likely unheard of in most. Here he presents legit science
wrapped up in similar dry humor. There are equations, but if you skip
them you won’t miss anything. There are also drawings, which shouldn’t
be passed over. The formula is: 1) Insert somewhat innocuous question
about how to do a standard human thing; 2) Take said question to the
extreme; and 3) Supported extreme answer with math and jokes. And it
works. Rare is the book that can handle Kant and Evil Knievel in
successive chapters.</p>
<p>What else is covered? Popular Culture: Is the dig at Oak Island worth
it?; Popular Wisdom: Is ‘red at night’ really a delight?; and Popular
Mechanics: How to best disable a flying drone? If you still aren’t
convinced, you’ll learn how far you can actually throw a given
object…and for that alone you should crack the cover.</p>

Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck</a>:</h4>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>By Mark Manson</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Online reviews of this book range from “Dude, totally best book ever”
to “This book is a poorly done ‘Buddhism for Bros’”. I fall somewhere in
the middle. It contains useful wisdom, wrapped, occasionally a bit
overly so, in modern context and lexicon. The title — clearly a
marketing win — sets the expectations of readers; which depending on how
far down the self-help (or Psychology PhD) path one has trod could be a
positive or negative push.</p>
<p>I took the following from this book, presented in what I gathered was
the author’s line of reasoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop worrying about unimportant things (giving a fuck). We all have
a limited set of things we can care about, make yours count
because:</li>
<li>Everyone has problems. The goal of life should be to have good
problems. ‘Good’ in the sense that you enjoy working on their solutions
because:</li>
<li>Human happiness stems not from having money/fame/power but from
solving problems. To the extent that these things can help you solve
good problems they are means, but not the end. <em>But I don’t choose my
own problems…Wait, do I?</em></li>
<li>Our values define our success metrics which in turn help determine
which problems we encounter and are working (or maybe not) to overcome.
Thus, set good values and good problems will result. <em>Ok, so what is
a ‘good’ value?</em></li>
<li>Good values have two features: 1) They are internally operable; they
do not require external acceptance; and 2) They are process-oriented,
not result-oriented (such values often violate #1). <em>Can I tell which
of the values that meet these criteria I should pursue?</em></li>
<li>What determines your success at fulfilling your values and solving
their associated problems is whether or not you are willing to endure
(enjoy) the suffering (work) it takes to express that value.
Essentially, you need to envision what work it would take to achieve
this value (to solve the problems associated with that value) and ask
yourself very honestly if you enjoy the process, the practice, the
suffering, the work — all of the negative aspects – that it would take
to reach this goal. If not, you won’t be successful.</li>
<li>In short: Stop chasing positive rewards, critically assess your
values, learn to enjoy the negative (work) associated with solving
problems and quit worrying about unimportant shit along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all, of course, aimed at well-to-do, existentially-confused
young westerners whose problems do not include access to clean water,
malaria, famine, war, despotism and other life threatening
circumstances. It is a quick read and, for those of us lucky enough to
have some say in what we ‘give a fuck about’, a worthwhile reminder of
the importance of setting the right values and in putting in the work
necessary to nurture, express and live those values.</p>

<h4><a
href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Prisoners-of-Geography-Audiobook/B01MFBS0ZZ">Prisoners
of Geography</a>:</h4>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>By Tim Marshall</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Don’t let the title fool you, this is as much or more of a history
book than a geography book. While the book is organized into chapters
based on ’10 maps that explain the world’, with a few exceptions, there
is almost a complete lack of interesting or useful maps to help the
narrative. The ’10 maps’ are simply ten countries/regions of focus —
each presented with a very standard political geography map. I spent no
small amount of time referencing Google Maps during my reading and feel
a sizable contribution of this book could have been in clearly locating
(mapping) the forces driving each country’s decisions, both past and
present.</p>
<p>The tagline here should be ‘selected geopolitics of the 20th and
early 21st century’. With that aim in mind, it is a successful book:
approachable, yet detailed. An undergraduate modern world history
seminar could do well by assigning this as a supplemental reader. A few
notable themes that emerge: 1) The disastrous consequences of colonial
powers drawing borders without regard for historical settlement
patterns; 2) The extractive development of the Southern Hemisphere
leading to large coastal capitals and underdeveloped hinterlands; and 3)
The continued importance of proximity in diplomacy (Moscow is near,
Washington is far).</p>
<p>Many of the (assumed) political motivations are discussed under the
umbrella of energy politics. Either I’m naive about the supremacy of
energy in driving (geo)politics or this book takes an overly simplistic
view. Truthfully, a mass market non-fiction book probably cannot do
justice to the full suite of considerations; nonetheless, Marshall
leaves the reader feeling as if the sole determinant of a state’s
actions are oil and natural gas. Barring the final chapter on the
Arctic, climate and ecological issues are given short shrift.
Technological capital and labor markets are thinly discussed as well.
Again, perhaps state machinations really are primarily driven by the
quest for hydrocarbons…and if so, it would explain the world’s
reluctance to address climate change and support alternative energy
solutions.</p>
<p>All in, it is a quick and worthwhile read. Many factoids and smaller
points of information may surprise — ex. the British traded their
overseas bases to the Americans for warships in 1940 — while the general
themes are broad and, somewhat evident. I was left with a sense of
foreboding; a collision between the US and China in the Pacific seems
imminent as does Russia’s dominance of the Arctic. Geography may end up
being a cruel jailer.</p>
